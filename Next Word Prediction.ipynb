       "' Not all that Mrs Bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr Bingley They attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas Her report was highly favourable Sir William had been delighted with him He was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party Nothing could be more delightful To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of Mr Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s heart were entertained â\\x80\\x9cIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfieldâ\\x80\\x9d said Mrs Bennet to her husband â\\x80\\x9cand all the others equally well married I shall have nothing to wish forâ\\x80\\x9d In a few days Mr Bingley returned Mr Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father The ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had Mrs Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all Mr Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc Mrs Bennet was quite disconcerted She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly The girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from London his five sisters and a cousin And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether Mr Bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man Mr Bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners His sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion His brotherinlaw Mr Hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr Bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend Mr Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves What a contrast between him and his friend Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs Hurst and once with Miss Bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party His character was decided He was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs Bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time Mr Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr Bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it â\\x80\\x9cCome Darcyâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cI must have you dance I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner You had much better danceâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI certainly shall not You know how I detest it unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable Your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up withâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI would not be so fastidious as you areâ\\x80\\x9d cried Bingley â\\x80\\x9cfor a kingdom Upon my honour I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly prettyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are dancing with the only handsome girl in the roomâ\\x80\\x9d said Mr Darcy looking at the eldest Miss Bennet â\\x80\\x9cOh she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and I dare say very agreeable Do let me ask my partner to introduce youâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhich do you meanâ\\x80\\x9d and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said â\\x80\\x9cShe is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with meâ\\x80\\x9d Mr Bingley followed his advice Mr Darcy walked off and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him She told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family Mrs Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party Mr Bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way Elizabeth felt Janeâ\\x80\\x99s pleasure Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants They found Mr Bennet still up With a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations He had rather hoped that all his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear â\\x80\\x9cOh my dear Mr Bennetâ\\x80\\x9d as she entered the room â\\x80\\x9cwe have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball I wish you had been there Jane was so admired nothing could be like it Everybody said how well she looked and Mr Bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice Only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time First of all he asked Miss Lucas I was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance So he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next Then the two third he danced with Miss King and the two fourth with Maria Lucas and the two fifth with Jane again and the two sixth with Lizzy and the Boulangerâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf he had had any compassion for meâ\\x80\\x9d cried her husband impatiently â\\x80\\x9che would not have danced half so much For Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake say no more of his partners Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first danceâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh my dearâ\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs Bennet â\\x80\\x9cI am quite delighted with him He is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses I dare say the lace upon Mrs Hurstâ\\x80\\x99s gownâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Here she was interrupted again Mr Bennet protested against any description of finery She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of Mr Darcy â\\x80\\x9cBut I can assure youâ\\x80\\x9d she added â\\x80\\x9cthat Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him He walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great Not handsome enough to dance with I wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your setdowns I quite detest the manâ\\x80\\x9d Chapter 4 When Jane and Elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of Mr Bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him â\\x80\\x9cHe is just what a young man ought to beâ\\x80\\x9d said she â\\x80\\x9csensible goodhumoured lively and I never saw such happy mannersâ\\x80\\x94so much ease with such perfect good breedingâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHe is also handsomeâ\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth â\\x80\\x9cwhich a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can His character is thereby completeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time I did not expect such a complimentâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDid not you I did for you But that is one great difference between us Compliments always take you by surprise and me never What could be more natural than his asking you again He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room No thanks to his gallantry for that Well he certainly is very agreeable and I give you leave to like him You have liked many a stupider personâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDear Lizzyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general You never see a fault in anybody All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my lifeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but I always speak what I thinkâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI know you do and it is that which makes the wonder With your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others Affectation of candour is common enoughâ\\x80\\x94one meets with it everywhere But to be candid without ostentation or designâ\\x80\\x94to take the good of everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s character and make it still better and say nothing of the badâ\\x80\\x94belongs to you alone And so you like this manâ\\x80\\x99s sisters too do you Their manners are not equal to hisâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCertainly not at first But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in herâ\\x80\\x9d Elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them They were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited They were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others They were of a respectable family in the north of England a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brotherâ\\x80\\x99s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade Mr Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it Mr Bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was Mrs Hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her Mr Bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House He did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of character Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied On the strength of Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion In understanding Darcy was the superior Bingley was by no means deficient but Darcy was clever He was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared Darcy was continually giving offence The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to Miss Bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful Darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much Mrs Hurst and her sister allowed it to be soâ\\x80\\x94but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose Chapter 5 Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton denominated from that period Lucas Lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world For though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody By nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at St Jamesâ\\x80\\x99s had made him courteous Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs Bennet They had several children The eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s intimate friend That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate â\\x80\\x9cYou began the evening well Charlotteâ\\x80\\x9d said Mrs Bennet with civil selfcommand to Miss Lucas â\\x80\\x9cYou were Mr Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s first choiceâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes but he seemed to like his second betterâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh you mean Jane I suppose because he danced with her twice To be sure that did seem as if he admired herâ\\x80\\x94indeed I rather believe he didâ\\x80\\x94I heard something about itâ\\x80\\x94but I hardly know whatâ\\x80\\x94something about Mr Robinsonâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr Robinson did not I mention it to you Mr Robinsonâ\\x80\\x99s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last questionâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Oh the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that pointâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word Well that was very decided indeedâ\\x80\\x94that does seem as ifâ\\x80\\x94but however it may all come to nothing you knowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMy overhearings were more to the purpose than yours Elizaâ\\x80\\x9d said Charlotte â\\x80\\x9cMr Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is heâ\\x80\\x94Poor Elizaâ\\x80\\x94to be only just tolerableâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI beg you would not put it into Lizzyâ\\x80\\x99s head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him Mrs Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lipsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAre you quite sure maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x94is not there a little mistakeâ\\x80\\x9d said Jane â\\x80\\x9cI certainly saw Mr Darcy speaking to herâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAyeâ\\x80\\x94because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke toâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMiss Bingley told meâ\\x80\\x9d said Jane â\\x80\\x9cthat he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance With them he is remarkably agreeableâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI do not believe a word of it my dear If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs Long But I can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs Long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaiseâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI do not mind his not talking to Mrs Longâ\\x80\\x9d said Miss Lucas â\\x80\\x9cbut I wish he had danced with Elizaâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnother time Lizzyâ\\x80\\x9d said her mother â\\x80\\x9cI would not dance with him if I were youâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI believe maâ\\x80\\x99am I may safely promise you never to dance with himâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHis prideâ\\x80\\x9d said Miss Lucas â\\x80\\x9cdoes not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself If I may so express it he has a right to be proudâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat is very trueâ\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth â\\x80\\x9cand I could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mineâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPrideâ\\x80\\x9d observed Mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections â\\x80\\x9cis a very common failing I believe By all that I have ever read I am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary Vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously A person may be proud without being vain Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of usâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf I were as rich as Mr Darcyâ\\x80\\x9d cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters â\\x80\\x9cI should not care how proud I was I would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every dayâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThen you would drink a great deal more than you oughtâ\\x80\\x9d said Mrs Bennet â\\x80\\x9cand if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directlyâ\\x80\\x9d The boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit Chapter 6 The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield The visit was returned in due form Miss Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to Jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brotherâ\\x80\\x99s admiration It was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since Jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas â\\x80\\x9cIt may perhaps be pleasantâ\\x80\\x9d replied Charlotte â\\x80\\x9cto be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself We can all begin freelyâ\\x80\\x94a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him onâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut she does help him on as much as her nature will allow If I can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it tooâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cRemember Eliza that he does not know Janeâ\\x80\\x99s disposition as you doâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it outâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps he must if he sees enough of her But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together Jane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attention When she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she choosesâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYour plan is a good oneâ\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth â\\x80\\x9cwhere nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if I were determined to get a rich husband or any husband I dare say I should adopt it But these are not Janeâ\\x80\\x99s feelings she is not acting by design As yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness She has known him only a fortnight She danced four dances with him at Meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times This is not quite enough to make her understand his characterâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNot as you represent it Had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherâ\\x80\\x94and four evenings may do a great dealâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingtun better than Commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic I do not imagine that much has been unfoldedâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x9d said Charlotte â\\x80\\x9cI wish Jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your lifeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou make me laugh Charlotte but it is not sound You know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d Occupied in observing Mr Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s attentions to her sister Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend Mr Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness Of this she was perfectly unawareâ\\x80\\x94to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with He began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others His doing so drew her notice It was at Sir William Lucasâ\\x80\\x99s where a large party were assembled â\\x80\\x9cWhat does Mr Darcy meanâ\\x80\\x9d said she to Charlotte â\\x80\\x9cby listening to my conversation with Colonel Forsterâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat is a question which Mr Darcy only can answerâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about He has a very satirical eye and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself I shall soon grow afraid of himâ\\x80\\x9d On his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said â\\x80\\x9cDid not you think Mr Darcy that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Merytonâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWith great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energeticâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are severe on usâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt will be her turn soon to be teasedâ\\x80\\x9d said Miss Lucas â\\x80\\x9cI am going to open the instrument Eliza and you know what followsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are a very strange creature by way of a friendâ\\x80\\x94always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody If my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performersâ\\x80\\x9d On Miss Lucasâ\\x80\\x99s persevering however she added â\\x80\\x9cVery well if it must be so it mustâ\\x80\\x9d And gravely glancing at Mr Darcy â\\x80\\x9cThere is a fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar withâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Keep your breath to cool your porridgeâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94and I shall keep mine to swell my songâ\\x80\\x9d Her performance was pleasing though by no means capital After a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display Mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached Elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and Mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room Mr Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour till Sir William thus began â\\x80\\x9cWhat a charming amusement for young people this is Mr Darcy There is nothing like dancing after all I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societiesâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCertainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the worldâ\\x80\\x94Every savage can danceâ\\x80\\x9d Sir William only smiled â\\x80\\x9cYour friend performs delightfullyâ\\x80\\x9d he continued after a pause on seeing Bingley join the group â\\x80\\x9cand I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself Mr Darcyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou saw me dance at Meryton I believe sirâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight Do you often dance at St Jamesâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNever sirâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the placeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid itâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou have a house in town I concludeâ\\x80\\x9d Mr Darcy bowed â\\x80\\x9cI had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselfâ\\x80\\x94for I am fond of superior society but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucasâ\\x80\\x9d He paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Eliza why are not you dancing Mr Darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner You cannot refuse to dance I am sure when so much beauty is before youâ\\x80\\x9d And taking her hand he would have given it to Mr Darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to Sir William â\\x80\\x9cIndeed sir I have not the least intention of dancing I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partnerâ\\x80\\x9d Mr Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain Elizabeth was determined nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion â\\x80\\x9cYou excel so much in the dance Miss Eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection I am sure to oblige us for one halfhourâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMr Darcy is all politenessâ\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth smiling â\\x80\\x9cHe is indeedâ\\x80\\x94but considering the inducement my dear Miss Eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partnerâ\\x80\\x9d Elizabeth looked archly and turned away Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by Miss Bingley â\\x80\\x9cI can guess the subject of your reverieâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI should imagine notâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerâ\\x80\\x94in such society and indeed I am quite of your opinion I was never more annoyed The insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all these people What would I give to hear your strictures on themâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYour conjecture is totally wrong I assure you My mind was more agreeably engaged I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestowâ\\x80\\x9d Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections Mr Darcy replied with great intrepidity â\\x80\\x9cMiss Elizabeth Bennetâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMiss Elizabeth Bennetâ\\x80\\x9d repeated Miss Bingley â\\x80\\x9cI am all astonishment How long has she been such a favouriteâ\\x80\\x94and pray when am I to wish you joyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly the question which I expected you to ask A ladyâ\\x80\\x99s imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment I knew you would be wishing me joyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNay if you are so serious about it I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled You will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will be always at Pemberley with youâ\\x80\\x9d He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long Chapter 7 Mr Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their motherâ\\x80\\x99s fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his Her father had been an attorney in Meryton and had left her four thousand pounds She had a sister married to a Mr Phillips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a millinerâ\\x80\\x99s shop just over the way The two youngest of the family Catherine and Lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sistersâ\\x80\\x99 and when nothing better offered a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt At present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and Meryton was the headquarters Their visits to Mrs Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence Every day added something to their knowledge of the officersâ\\x80\\x99 names and connections Their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves Mr Philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before They could talk of nothing but officers and Mr Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject Mr Bennet coolly observed â\\x80\\x9cFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country I have suspected it some time but I am now convincedâ\\x80\\x9d Catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but Lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to London â\\x80\\x9cI am astonished my dearâ\\x80\\x9d said Mrs Bennet â\\x80\\x9cthat you should be so ready to think your own children silly If I wished to think slightingly of anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s children it should not be of my own howeverâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of itâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94but as it happens they are all of them very cleverâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThis is the only point I flatter myself on which we do not agree I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolishâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Mr Bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very wellâ\\x80\\x94and indeed so I do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir Williamâ\\x80\\x99s in his regimentalsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMammaâ\\x80\\x9d cried Lydia â\\x80\\x9cmy aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watsonâ\\x80\\x99s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in Clarkeâ\\x80\\x99s libraryâ\\x80\\x9d Mrs Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet it came from Netherfield and the servant waited for an answer Mrs Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read â\\x80\\x9cWell Jane who is it from What is it about What does he say Well Jane make haste and tell us make haste my loveâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt is from Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x9d said Jane and then read it aloud â\\x80\\x9cMY DEAR FRIENDâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cIf you are not so compassionate as to dine today with Louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole dayâ\\x80\\x99s tÃªteÃ tÃªte between two women can never end without a quarrel Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officersâ\\x80\\x94Yours ever â\\x80\\x9cCAROLINE BINGLEYâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWith the officersâ\\x80\\x9d cried Lydia â\\x80\\x9cI wonder my aunt did not tell us of thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDining outâ\\x80\\x9d said Mrs Bennet â\\x80\\x9cthat is very unluckyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCan I have the carriageâ\\x80\\x9d said Jane â\\x80\\x9cNo my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all nightâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat would be a good schemeâ\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth â\\x80\\x9cif you were sure that they would not offer to send her homeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh but the gentlemen will have Mr Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s chaise to go to Meryton and the Hursts have no horses to theirsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI had much rather go in the coachâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut my dear your father cannot spare the horses I am sure They are wanted in the farm Mr Bennet are not theyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThey are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get themâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut if you have got them todayâ\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth â\\x80\\x9cmy motherâ\\x80\\x99s purpose will be answeredâ\\x80\\x9d She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day Her hopes were answered Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard Her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted The rain continued the whole evening without intermission Jane certainly could not come back â\\x80\\x9cThis was a lucky idea of mine indeedâ\\x80\\x9d said Mrs Bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own Till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth â\\x80\\x9cMY DEAREST LIZZYâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cI find myself very unwell this morning which I suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better They insist also on my seeing Mr Jonesâ\\x80\\x94therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meâ\\x80\\x94and excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the matter with meâ\\x80\\x94Yours &câ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell my dearâ\\x80\\x9d said Mr Bennet when Elizabeth had read the note aloud â\\x80\\x9cif your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessâ\\x80\\x94if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr Bingley and under your ordersâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh I am not at all afraid of her dying People do not die of little trifling colds She will be taken good care of As long as she stays there it is all very well I would go and see her if I could have the carriageâ\\x80\\x9d Elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative She declared her resolution â\\x80\\x9cHow can you be so sillyâ\\x80\\x9d cried her mother â\\x80\\x9cas to think of such a thing in all this dirt You will not be fit to be seen when you get thereâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI shall be very fit to see Janeâ\\x80\\x94which is all I wantâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIs this a hint to me Lizzyâ\\x80\\x9d said her father â\\x80\\x9cto send for the horsesâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo indeed I do not wish to avoid the walk The distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles I shall be back by dinnerâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI admire the activity of your benevolenceâ\\x80\\x9d observed Mary â\\x80\\x9cbut every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is requiredâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe will go as far as Meryton with youâ\\x80\\x9d said Catherine and Lydia Elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together â\\x80\\x9cIf we make hasteâ\\x80\\x9d said Lydia as they walked along â\\x80\\x9cperhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goesâ\\x80\\x9d In Meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officersâ\\x80\\x99 wives and CHAPTER I Down the RabbitHole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it â\\x80\\x9cand what is the use of a bookâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cwithout pictures or conversationsâ\\x80\\x9d So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her There was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself â\\x80\\x9cOh dear Oh dear I shall be lateâ\\x80\\x9d (when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural) but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried on Alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge In another moment down went Alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again The rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next First she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled â\\x80\\x9cORANGE MARMALADEâ\\x80\\x9d but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it â\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice to herself â\\x80\\x9cafter such a fall as this I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs How brave theyâ\\x80\\x99ll all think me at home Why I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the houseâ\\x80\\x9d (Which was very likely true) Down down down Would the fall never come to an end â\\x80\\x9cI wonder how many miles Iâ\\x80\\x99ve fallen by this timeâ\\x80\\x9d she said aloud â\\x80\\x9cI must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth Let me see that would be four thousand miles down I thinkâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d (for you see Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over) â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94yes thatâ\\x80\\x99s about the right distanceâ\\x80\\x94but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got toâ\\x80\\x9d (Alice had no idea what Latitude was or Longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say) Presently she began again â\\x80\\x9cI wonder if I shall fall right through the earth How funny itâ\\x80\\x99ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward The Antipathies I thinkâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d (she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didnâ\\x80\\x99t sound at all the right word) â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know Please Maâ\\x80\\x99am is this New Zealand or Australiaâ\\x80\\x9d (and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâ\\x80\\x94fancy curtseying as youâ\\x80\\x99re falling through the air Do you think you could manage it) â\\x80\\x9cAnd what an ignorant little girl sheâ\\x80\\x99ll think me for asking No itâ\\x80\\x99ll never do to ask perhaps I shall see it written up somewhereâ\\x80\\x9d Down down down There was nothing else to do so Alice soon began talking again â\\x80\\x9cDinahâ\\x80\\x99ll miss me very much tonight I should thinkâ\\x80\\x9d (Dinah was the cat) â\\x80\\x9cI hope theyâ\\x80\\x99ll remember her saucer of milk at teatime Dinah my dear I wish you were down here with me There are no mice in the air Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid but you might catch a bat and thatâ\\x80\\x99s very like a mouse you know But do cats eat bats I wonderâ\\x80\\x9d And here Alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way â\\x80\\x9cDo cats eat bats Do cats eat batsâ\\x80\\x9d and sometimes â\\x80\\x9cDo bats eat catsâ\\x80\\x9d for you see as she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t answer either question it didnâ\\x80\\x99t much matter which way she put it She felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah and saying to her very earnestly â\\x80\\x9cNow Dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a batâ\\x80\\x9d when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it There was not a moment to be lost away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner â\\x80\\x9cOh my ears and whiskers how late itâ\\x80\\x99s gettingâ\\x80\\x9d She was close behind it when she turned the corner but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again Suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them However on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway â\\x80\\x9cand even if my head would go throughâ\\x80\\x9d thought poor Alice â\\x80\\x9cit would be of very little use without my shoulders Oh how I wish I could shut up like a telescope I think I could if I only knew how to beginâ\\x80\\x9d For you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it (â\\x80\\x9cwhich certainly was not here beforeâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words â\\x80\\x9cDRINK MEâ\\x80\\x9d beautifully printed on it in large letters It was all very well to say â\\x80\\x9cDrink meâ\\x80\\x9d but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry â\\x80\\x9cNo Iâ\\x80\\x99ll look firstâ\\x80\\x9d she said â\\x80\\x9cand see whether itâ\\x80\\x99s marked â\\x80\\x98poisonâ\\x80\\x99 or notâ\\x80\\x9d for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked â\\x80\\x9cpoisonâ\\x80\\x9d it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later However this bottle was not marked â\\x80\\x9cpoisonâ\\x80\\x9d so Alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice (it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast) she very soon finished it off â\\x80\\x9cWhat a curious feelingâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cI must be shutting up like a telescopeâ\\x80\\x9d And so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden First however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this â\\x80\\x9cfor it might end you knowâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice to herself â\\x80\\x9cin my going out altogether like a candle I wonder what I should be like thenâ\\x80\\x9d And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing After a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor Alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried â\\x80\\x9cCome thereâ\\x80\\x99s no use in crying like thatâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice to herself rather sharply â\\x80\\x9cI advise you to leave off this minuteâ\\x80\\x9d She generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it) and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s no use nowâ\\x80\\x9d thought poor Alice â\\x80\\x9cto pretend to be two people Why thereâ\\x80\\x99s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable personâ\\x80\\x9d Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words â\\x80\\x9cEAT MEâ\\x80\\x9d were beautifully marked in currants â\\x80\\x9cWell Iâ\\x80\\x99ll eat itâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cand if it makes me grow larger I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep under the door so either way Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get into the garden and I donâ\\x80\\x99t care which happensâ\\x80\\x9d She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself â\\x80\\x9cWhich way Which wayâ\\x80\\x9d holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake CHAPTER II The Pool of Tears â\\x80\\x9cCuriouser and curiouserâ\\x80\\x9d cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English) â\\x80\\x9cnow Iâ\\x80\\x99m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was Goodbye feetâ\\x80\\x9d (for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off) â\\x80\\x9cOh my poor little feet I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I shanâ\\x80\\x99t be able I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you canâ\\x80\\x94but I must be kind to themâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cor perhaps they wonâ\\x80\\x99t walk the way I want to go Let me see Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmasâ\\x80\\x9d And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it â\\x80\\x9cThey must go by the carrierâ\\x80\\x9d she thought â\\x80\\x9cand how funny itâ\\x80\\x99ll seem sending presents to oneâ\\x80\\x99s own feet And how odd the directions will look Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s Right Foot Esq Hearthrug near the Fender (with Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s love) Oh dear what nonsense Iâ\\x80\\x99m talkingâ\\x80\\x9d Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door Poor Alice It was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again â\\x80\\x9cYou ought to be ashamed of yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9ca great girl like youâ\\x80\\x9d (she might well say this) â\\x80\\x9cto go on crying in this way Stop this moment I tell youâ\\x80\\x9d But she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming It was the White Rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came â\\x80\\x9cOh the Duchess the Duchess Oh wonâ\\x80\\x99t she be savage if Iâ\\x80\\x99ve kept her waitingâ\\x80\\x9d Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the Rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice â\\x80\\x9cIf you please sirâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d The Rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking â\\x80\\x9cDear dear How queer everything is today And yesterday things went on just as usual I wonder if Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been changed in the night Let me think was I the same when I got up this morning I almost think I can remember feeling a little different But if Iâ\\x80\\x99m not the same the next question is Who in the world am I Ah thatâ\\x80\\x99s the great puzzleâ\\x80\\x9d And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure Iâ\\x80\\x99m not Adaâ\\x80\\x9d she said â\\x80\\x9cfor her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnâ\\x80\\x99t go in ringlets at all and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I canâ\\x80\\x99t be Mabel for I know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little Besides sheâ\\x80\\x99s she and Iâ\\x80\\x99m I andâ\\x80\\x94oh dear how puzzling it all is Iâ\\x80\\x99ll try if I know all the things I used to know Let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isâ\\x80\\x94oh dear I shall never get to twenty at that rate However the Multiplication Table doesnâ\\x80\\x99t signify letâ\\x80\\x99s try Geography London is the capital of Paris and Paris is the capital of Rome and Romeâ\\x80\\x94no thatâ\\x80\\x99s all wrong Iâ\\x80\\x99m certain I must have been changed for Mabel Iâ\\x80\\x99ll try and say â\\x80\\x98How doth the littleâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to doâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cHow doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale â\\x80\\x9cHow cheerfully he seems to grin How neatly spread his claws And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jawsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure those are not the right wordsâ\\x80\\x9d said poor Alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on â\\x80\\x9cI must be Mabel after all and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn No Iâ\\x80\\x99ve made up my mind about it if Iâ\\x80\\x99m Mabel Iâ\\x80\\x99ll stay down here Itâ\\x80\\x99ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying â\\x80\\x98Come up again dearâ\\x80\\x99 I shall only look up and say â\\x80\\x98Who am I then Tell me that first and then if I like being that person Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come up if not Iâ\\x80\\x99ll stay down here till Iâ\\x80\\x99m somebody elseâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94but oh dearâ\\x80\\x9d cried Alice with a sudden burst of tears â\\x80\\x9cI do wish they would put their heads down I am so very tired of being all alone hereâ\\x80\\x9d As she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbitâ\\x80\\x99s little white kid gloves while she was talking â\\x80\\x9cHow can I have done thatâ\\x80\\x9d she thought â\\x80\\x9cI must be growing small againâ\\x80\\x9d She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether â\\x80\\x9cThat was a narrow escapeâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence â\\x80\\x9cand now for the gardenâ\\x80\\x9d and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before â\\x80\\x9cand things are worse than everâ\\x80\\x9d thought the poor child â\\x80\\x9cfor I never was so small as this before never And I declare itâ\\x80\\x99s too bad that it isâ\\x80\\x9d As she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea â\\x80\\x9cand in that case I can go back by railwayâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station) However she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high â\\x80\\x9cI wish I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t cried so muchâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice as she swam about trying to find her way out â\\x80\\x9cI shall be punished for it now I suppose by being drowned in my own tears That will be a queer thing to be sure However everything is queer todayâ\\x80\\x9d Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself â\\x80\\x9cWould it be of any use nowâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cto speak to this mouse Everything is so outoftheway down here that I should think very likely it can talk at any rate thereâ\\x80\\x99s no harm in tryingâ\\x80\\x9d So she began â\\x80\\x9cO Mouse do you know the way out of this pool I am very tired of swimming about here O Mouseâ\\x80\\x9d (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s Latin Grammar â\\x80\\x9cA mouseâ\\x80\\x94of a mouseâ\\x80\\x94to a mouseâ\\x80\\x94a mouseâ\\x80\\x94O mouseâ\\x80\\x9d) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t understand Englishâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cI daresay itâ\\x80\\x99s a French mouse come over with William the Conquerorâ\\x80\\x9d (For with all her knowledge of history Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened) So she began again â\\x80\\x9cOÃ¹ est ma chatteâ\\x80\\x9d which was the first sentence in her French lessonbook The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright â\\x80\\x9cOh I beg your pardonâ\\x80\\x9d cried Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animalâ\\x80\\x99s feelings â\\x80\\x9cI quite forgot you didnâ\\x80\\x99t like catsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNot like catsâ\\x80\\x9d cried the Mouse in a shrill passionate voice â\\x80\\x9cWould you like cats if you were meâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell perhaps notâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a soothing tone â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t be angry about it And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah I think youâ\\x80\\x99d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her She is such a dear quiet thingâ\\x80\\x9d Alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool â\\x80\\x9cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceâ\\x80\\x94and she is such a nice soft thing to nurseâ\\x80\\x94and sheâ\\x80\\x99s such a capital one for catching miceâ\\x80\\x94oh I beg your pardonâ\\x80\\x9d cried Alice again for this time the Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended â\\x80\\x9cWe wonâ\\x80\\x99t talk about her any more if youâ\\x80\\x99d rather notâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe indeedâ\\x80\\x9d cried the Mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail â\\x80\\x9cAs if I would talk on such a subject Our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things Donâ\\x80\\x99t let me hear the name againâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t indeedâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation â\\x80\\x9cAre youâ\\x80\\x94are you fondâ\\x80\\x94ofâ\\x80\\x94of dogsâ\\x80\\x9d The Mouse did not answer so Alice went on eagerly â\\x80\\x9cThere is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you A little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair And itâ\\x80\\x99ll fetch things when you throw them and itâ\\x80\\x99ll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsâ\\x80\\x94I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember half of themâ\\x80\\x94and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says itâ\\x80\\x99s so useful itâ\\x80\\x99s worth a hundred pounds He says it kills all the rats andâ\\x80\\x94oh dearâ\\x80\\x9d cried Alice in a sorrowful tone â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid Iâ\\x80\\x99ve offended it againâ\\x80\\x9d For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went So she called softly after it â\\x80\\x9cMouse dear Do come back again and we wonâ\\x80\\x99t talk about cats or dogs either if you donâ\\x80\\x99t like themâ\\x80\\x9d When the Mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale (with passion Alice thought) and it said in a low trembling voice â\\x80\\x9cLet us get to the shore and then Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you my history and youâ\\x80\\x99ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogsâ\\x80\\x9d It was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a Duck and a Dodo a Lory and an Eaglet and several other curious creatures Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore CHAPTER III A CaucusRace and a Long Tale They were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bankâ\\x80\\x94the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable The first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life Indeed she had quite a long argument with the Lory who at last turned sulky and would only say â\\x80\\x9cI am older than you and must know betterâ\\x80\\x9d and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the Lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said At last the Mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out â\\x80\\x9cSit down all of you and listen to me Iâ\\x80\\x99ll soon make you dry enoughâ\\x80\\x9d They all sat down at once in a large ring with the Mouse in the middle Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon â\\x80\\x9cAhemâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse with an important air â\\x80\\x9care you all ready This is the driest thing I know Silence all round if you please â\\x80\\x98William the Conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the English who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest Edwin and Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbriaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cUghâ\\x80\\x9d said the Lory with a shiver â\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardonâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse frowning but very politely â\\x80\\x9cDid you speakâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNot Iâ\\x80\\x9d said the Lory hastily â\\x80\\x9cI thought you didâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94I proceed â\\x80\\x98Edwin and Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria declared for him and even Stigand the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury found it advisableâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cFound whatâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duck â\\x80\\x9cFound itâ\\x80\\x9d the Mouse replied rather crossly â\\x80\\x9cof course you know what â\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99 meansâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI know what â\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99 means well enough when I find a thingâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duck â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s generally a frog or a worm The question is what did the archbishop findâ\\x80\\x9d The Mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x94found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown Williamâ\\x80\\x99s conduct at first was moderate But the insolence of his Normansâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 How are you getting on now my dearâ\\x80\\x9d it continued turning to Alice as it spoke â\\x80\\x9cAs wet as everâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a melancholy tone â\\x80\\x9cit doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to dry me at allâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIn that caseâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dodo solemnly rising to its feet â\\x80\\x9cI move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remediesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSpeak Englishâ\\x80\\x9d said the Eaglet â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know the meaning of half those long words and whatâ\\x80\\x99s more I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe you do eitherâ\\x80\\x9d And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly â\\x80\\x9cWhat I was going to sayâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dodo in an offended tone â\\x80\\x9cwas that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucusraceâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat is a Caucusraceâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice not that she wanted much to know but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything â\\x80\\x9cWhyâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dodo â\\x80\\x9cthe best way to explain it is to do itâ\\x80\\x9d (And as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day I will tell you how the Dodo managed it) First it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle (â\\x80\\x9cthe exact shape doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matterâ\\x80\\x9d it said) and then all the party were placed along the course here and there There was no â\\x80\\x9cOne two three and awayâ\\x80\\x9d but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over However when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the Dodo suddenly called out â\\x80\\x9cThe race is overâ\\x80\\x9d and they all crowded round it panting and asking â\\x80\\x9cBut who has wonâ\\x80\\x9d This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare in the pictures of him) while the rest waited in silence At last the Dodo said â\\x80\\x9cEverybody has won and all must have prizesâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut who is to give the prizesâ\\x80\\x9d quite a chorus of voices asked â\\x80\\x9cWhy she of courseâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dodo pointing to Alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way â\\x80\\x9cPrizes Prizesâ\\x80\\x9d Alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt water had not got into it) and handed them round as prizes There was exactly one apiece all round â\\x80\\x9cBut she must have a prize herself you knowâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse â\\x80\\x9cOf courseâ\\x80\\x9d the Dodo replied very gravely â\\x80\\x9cWhat else have you got in your pocketâ\\x80\\x9d he went on turning to Alice â\\x80\\x9cOnly a thimbleâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice sadly â\\x80\\x9cHand it over hereâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dodo Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying â\\x80\\x9cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimbleâ\\x80\\x9d and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could The next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back However it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more â\\x80\\x9cYou promised to tell me your history you knowâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cand why it is you hateâ\\x80\\x94C and Dâ\\x80\\x9d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again â\\x80\\x9cMine is a long and a sad taleâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse turning to Alice and sighing â\\x80\\x9cIt is a long tail certainlyâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice looking down with wonder at the Mouseâ\\x80\\x99s tail â\\x80\\x9cbut why do you call it sadâ\\x80\\x9d And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like thisâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cFury said to a mouse That he met in the house â\\x80\\x98Let us both go to law I will prosecute youâ\\x80\\x94Come Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take no denial We must have a trial For really this morning Iâ\\x80\\x99ve nothing to doâ\\x80\\x99 Said the mouse to the cur â\\x80\\x98Such a trial dear sir With no jury or judge would be wasting our breathâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be judge Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be juryâ\\x80\\x99 Said cunning old Fury â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll try the whole cause and condemn you to deathâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are not attendingâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse to Alice severely â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you thinking ofâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardonâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice very humbly â\\x80\\x9cyou had got to the fifth bend I thinkâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI had notâ\\x80\\x9d cried the Mouse sharply and very angrily â\\x80\\x9cA knotâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her â\\x80\\x9cOh do let me help to undo itâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI shall do nothing of the sortâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse getting up and walking away â\\x80\\x9cYou insult me by talking such nonsenseâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean itâ\\x80\\x9d pleaded poor Alice â\\x80\\x9cBut youâ\\x80\\x99re so easily offended you knowâ\\x80\\x9d The Mouse only growled in reply â\\x80\\x9cPlease come back and finish your storyâ\\x80\\x9d Alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus â\\x80\\x9cYes please doâ\\x80\\x9d but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker â\\x80\\x9cWhat a pity it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t stayâ\\x80\\x9d sighed the Lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter â\\x80\\x9cAh my dear Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temperâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHold your tongue Maâ\\x80\\x9d said the young Crab a little snappishly â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re enough to try the patience of an oysterâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI wish I had our Dinah here I know I doâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice aloud addressing nobody in particular â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99d soon fetch it backâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd who is Dinah if I might venture to ask the questionâ\\x80\\x9d said the Lory Alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet â\\x80\\x9cDinahâ\\x80\\x99s our cat And sheâ\\x80\\x99s such a capital one for catching mice you canâ\\x80\\x99t think And oh I wish you could see her after the birds Why sheâ\\x80\\x99ll eat a little bird as soon as look at itâ\\x80\\x9d This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party Some of the birds hurried off at once one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking â\\x80\\x9cI really must be getting home the nightair doesnâ\\x80\\x99t suit my throatâ\\x80\\x9d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children â\\x80\\x9cCome away my dears Itâ\\x80\\x99s high time you were all in bedâ\\x80\\x9d On various pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone â\\x80\\x9cI wish I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t mentioned Dinahâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself in a melancholy tone â\\x80\\x9cNobody seems to like her down here and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure sheâ\\x80\\x99s the best cat in the world Oh my dear Dinah I wonder if I shall ever see you any moreâ\\x80\\x9d And here poor Alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspirited In a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story CHAPTER IV The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself â\\x80\\x9cThe Duchess The Duchess Oh my dear paws Oh my fur and whiskers Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets Where can I have dropped them I wonderâ\\x80\\x9d Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seenâ\\x80\\x94everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone â\\x80\\x9cWhy Mary Ann what are you doing out here Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan Quick nowâ\\x80\\x9d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made â\\x80\\x9cHe took me for his housemaidâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself as she ran â\\x80\\x9cHow surprised heâ\\x80\\x99ll be when he finds out who I am But Iâ\\x80\\x99d better take him his fan and glovesâ\\x80\\x94that is if I can find themâ\\x80\\x9d As she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name â\\x80\\x9cW RABBITâ\\x80\\x9d engraved upon it She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves â\\x80\\x9cHow queer it seemsâ\\x80\\x9d Alice said to herself â\\x80\\x9cto be going messages for a rabbit I suppose Dinahâ\\x80\\x99ll be sending me on messages nextâ\\x80\\x9d And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Miss Alice Come here directly and get ready for your walkâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Coming in a minute nurse But Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to see that the mouse doesnâ\\x80\\x99t get outâ\\x80\\x99 Only I donâ\\x80\\x99t thinkâ\\x80\\x9d Alice went on â\\x80\\x9cthat theyâ\\x80\\x99d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like thatâ\\x80\\x9d By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass There was no label this time with the words â\\x80\\x9cDRINK MEâ\\x80\\x9d but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips â\\x80\\x9cI know something interesting is sure to happenâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself â\\x80\\x9cwhenever I eat or drink anything so Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just see what this bottle does I do hope itâ\\x80\\x99ll make me grow large again for really Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite tired of being such a tiny little thingâ\\x80\\x9d It did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken She hastily put down the bottle saying to herself â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s quite enoughâ\\x80\\x94I hope I shanâ\\x80\\x99t grow any moreâ\\x80\\x94As it is I canâ\\x80\\x99t get out at the doorâ\\x80\\x94I do wish I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t drunk quite so muchâ\\x80\\x9d Alas it was too late to wish that She went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head Still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself â\\x80\\x9cNow I can do no more whatever happens What will become of meâ\\x80\\x9d Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy â\\x80\\x9cIt was much pleasanter at homeâ\\x80\\x9d thought poor Alice â\\x80\\x9cwhen one wasnâ\\x80\\x99t always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits I almost wish I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t gone down that rabbitholeâ\\x80\\x94and yetâ\\x80\\x94and yetâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s rather curious you know this sort of life I do wonder what can have happened to me When I used to read fairytales I fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here I am in the middle of one There ought to be a book written about me that there ought And when I grow up Iâ\\x80\\x99ll write oneâ\\x80\\x94but Iâ\\x80\\x99m grown up nowâ\\x80\\x9d she added in a sorrowful tone â\\x80\\x9cat least thereâ\\x80\\x99s no room to grow up any more hereâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut thenâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cshall I never get any older than I am now Thatâ\\x80\\x99ll be a comfort one wayâ\\x80\\x94never to be an old womanâ\\x80\\x94but thenâ\\x80\\x94always to have lessons to learn Oh I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t like thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh you foolish Aliceâ\\x80\\x9d she answered herself â\\x80\\x9cHow can you learn lessons in here Why thereâ\\x80\\x99s hardly room for you and no room at all for any lessonbooksâ\\x80\\x9d And so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen â\\x80\\x9cMary Ann Mary Annâ\\x80\\x9d said the voice â\\x80\\x9cFetch me my gloves this momentâ\\x80\\x9d Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure Alice heard it say to itself â\\x80\\x9cThen Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go round and get in at the windowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat you wonâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air She did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something of the sort Next came an angry voiceâ\\x80\\x94the Rabbitâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cPat Pat Where are youâ\\x80\\x9d And then a voice she had never heard before â\\x80\\x9cSure then Iâ\\x80\\x99m here Digging for apples yer honourâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDigging for apples indeedâ\\x80\\x9d said the Rabbit angrily â\\x80\\x9cHere Come and help me out of thisâ\\x80\\x9d (Sounds of more broken glass) â\\x80\\x9cNow tell me Pat whatâ\\x80\\x99s that in the windowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSure itâ\\x80\\x99s an arm yer honourâ\\x80\\x9d (He pronounced it â\\x80\\x9carrumâ\\x80\\x9d) â\\x80\\x9cAn arm you goose Who ever saw one that size Why it fills the whole windowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSure it does yer honour but itâ\\x80\\x99s an arm for all thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell itâ\\x80\\x99s got no business there at any rate go and take it awayâ\\x80\\x9d There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then such as â\\x80\\x9cSure I donâ\\x80\\x99t like it yer honour at all at allâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDo as I tell you you cowardâ\\x80\\x9d and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air This time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass â\\x80\\x9cWhat a number of cucumberframes there must beâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cI wonder what theyâ\\x80\\x99ll do next As for pulling me out of the window I only wish they could Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to stay in here any longerâ\\x80\\x9d She waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words â\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s the other ladderâ\\x80\\x94Why I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t to bring but one Billâ\\x80\\x99s got the otherâ\\x80\\x94Bill fetch it here ladâ\\x80\\x94Here put â\\x80\\x99em up at this cornerâ\\x80\\x94No tie â\\x80\\x99em together firstâ\\x80\\x94they donâ\\x80\\x99t reach half high enough yetâ\\x80\\x94Oh theyâ\\x80\\x99ll do well enough donâ\\x80\\x99t be particularâ\\x80\\x94Here Bill catch hold of this ropeâ\\x80\\x94Will the roof bearâ\\x80\\x94Mind that loose slateâ\\x80\\x94Oh itâ\\x80\\x99s coming down Heads belowâ\\x80\\x9d (a loud crash)â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cNow who did thatâ\\x80\\x94It was Bill I fancyâ\\x80\\x94Whoâ\\x80\\x99s to go down the chimneyâ\\x80\\x94Nay I shanâ\\x80\\x99t You do itâ\\x80\\x94That I wonâ\\x80\\x99t thenâ\\x80\\x94Billâ\\x80\\x99s to go downâ\\x80\\x94Here Bill the master says youâ\\x80\\x99re to go down the chimneyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh So Billâ\\x80\\x99s got to come down the chimney has heâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice to herself â\\x80\\x9cShy they seem to put everything upon Bill I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be in Billâ\\x80\\x99s place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but I think I can kick a littleâ\\x80\\x9d She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself â\\x80\\x9cThis is Billâ\\x80\\x9d she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next The first thing she heard was a general chorus of â\\x80\\x9cThere goes Billâ\\x80\\x9d then the Rabbitâ\\x80\\x99s voice alongâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cCatch him you by the hedgeâ\\x80\\x9d then silence and then another confusion of voicesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cHold up his headâ\\x80\\x94Brandy nowâ\\x80\\x94Donâ\\x80\\x99t choke himâ\\x80\\x94How was it old fellow What happened to you Tell us all about itâ\\x80\\x9d Last came a little feeble squeaking voice (â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s Billâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice) â\\x80\\x9cWell I hardly knowâ\\x80\\x94No more thank ye Iâ\\x80\\x99m better nowâ\\x80\\x94but Iâ\\x80\\x99m a deal too flustered to tell youâ\\x80\\x94all I know is something comes at me like a Jackinthebox and up I goes like a skyrocketâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSo you did old fellowâ\\x80\\x9d said the others â\\x80\\x9cWe must burn the house downâ\\x80\\x9d said the Rabbitâ\\x80\\x99s voice and Alice called out as loud as she could â\\x80\\x9cIf you do Iâ\\x80\\x99ll set Dinah at youâ\\x80\\x9d There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to herself â\\x80\\x9cI wonder what they will do next If they had any sense theyâ\\x80\\x99d take the roof offâ\\x80\\x9d After a minute or two they began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say â\\x80\\x9cA barrowful will do to begin withâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA barrowful of whatâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll put a stop to thisâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself and shouted out â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better not do that againâ\\x80\\x9d which produced another dead silence Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head â\\x80\\x9cIf I eat one of these cakesâ\\x80\\x9d she thought â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s sure to make some change in my size and as it canâ\\x80\\x99t possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I supposeâ\\x80\\x9d So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly As soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside The poor little Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood â\\x80\\x9cThe first thing Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to doâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood â\\x80\\x9cis to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden I think that will be the best planâ\\x80\\x9d It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her â\\x80\\x9cPoor little thingâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing Hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppyâ\\x80\\x99s bark sounded quite faint in the distance â\\x80\\x9cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it wasâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves â\\x80\\x9cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifâ\\x80\\x94if Iâ\\x80\\x99d only been the right size to do it Oh dear Iâ\\x80\\x99d nearly forgotten that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to grow up again Let me seeâ\\x80\\x94how is it to be managed I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is whatâ\\x80\\x9d The great question certainly was what Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances There was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else CHAPTER V Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice â\\x80\\x9cWho are youâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation Alice replied rather shyly â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I hardly know sir just at presentâ\\x80\\x94at least I know who I was when I got up this morning but I think I must have been changed several times since thenâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean by thatâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar sternly â\\x80\\x9cExplain yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t explain myself Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid sirâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cbecause Iâ\\x80\\x99m not myself you seeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t seeâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid I canâ\\x80\\x99t put it more clearlyâ\\x80\\x9d Alice replied very politely â\\x80\\x9cfor I canâ\\x80\\x99t understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusingâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar â\\x80\\x9cWell perhaps you havenâ\\x80\\x99t found it so yetâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cbut when you have to turn into a chrysalisâ\\x80\\x94you will some day you knowâ\\x80\\x94and then after that into a butterfly I should think youâ\\x80\\x99ll feel it a little queer wonâ\\x80\\x99t youâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNot a bitâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar â\\x80\\x9cWell perhaps your feelings may be differentâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9call I know is it would feel very queer to meâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar contemptuously â\\x80\\x9cWho are youâ\\x80\\x9d Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillarâ\\x80\\x99s making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely â\\x80\\x9cI think you ought to tell me who you are firstâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhyâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not think of any good reason and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away â\\x80\\x9cCome backâ\\x80\\x9d the Caterpillar called after her â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve something important to sayâ\\x80\\x9d This sounded promising certainly Alice turned and came back again â\\x80\\x9cKeep your temperâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar â\\x80\\x9cIs that allâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could â\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing For some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said â\\x80\\x9cSo you think youâ\\x80\\x99re changed do youâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid I am sirâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t remember things as I usedâ\\x80\\x94and I donâ\\x80\\x99t keep the same size for ten minutes togetherâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t remember what thingsâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar â\\x80\\x9cWell Iâ\\x80\\x99ve tried to say â\\x80\\x9cHow doth the little busy beeâ\\x80\\x9d but it all came differentâ\\x80\\x9d Alice replied in a very melancholy voice â\\x80\\x9cRepeat â\\x80\\x9cYou are old Father Williamâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar Alice folded her hands and beganâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cYou are old Father Williamâ\\x80\\x9d the young man said â\\x80\\x9cAnd your hair has become very white And yet you incessantly stand on your headâ\\x80\\x94 Do you think at your age it is rightâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIn my youthâ\\x80\\x9d Father William replied to his son â\\x80\\x9cI feared it might injure the brain But now that Iâ\\x80\\x99m perfectly sure I have none Why I do it again and againâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are oldâ\\x80\\x9d said the youth â\\x80\\x9cas I mentioned before And have grown most uncommonly fat Yet you turned a backsomersault in at the doorâ\\x80\\x94 Pray what is the reason of thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIn my youthâ\\x80\\x9d said the sage as he shook his grey locks â\\x80\\x9cI kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointmentâ\\x80\\x94one shilling the boxâ\\x80\\x94 Allow me to sell you a coupleâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are oldâ\\x80\\x9d said the youth â\\x80\\x9cand your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet Yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beakâ\\x80\\x94 Pray how did you manage to do itâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIn my youthâ\\x80\\x9d said his father â\\x80\\x9cI took to the law And argued each case with my wife And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw Has lasted the rest of my lifeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are oldâ\\x80\\x9d said the youth â\\x80\\x9cone would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your noseâ\\x80\\x94 What made you so awfully cleverâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI have answered three questions and that is enoughâ\\x80\\x9d Said his father â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t give yourself airs Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff Be off or Iâ\\x80\\x99ll kick you down stairsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat is not said rightâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar â\\x80\\x9cNot quite right Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraidâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice timidly â\\x80\\x9csome of the words have got alteredâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt is wrong from beginning to endâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes The Caterpillar was the first to speak â\\x80\\x9cWhat size do you want to beâ\\x80\\x9d it asked â\\x80\\x9cOh Iâ\\x80\\x99m not particular as to sizeâ\\x80\\x9d Alice hastily replied â\\x80\\x9conly one doesnâ\\x80\\x99t like changing so often you knowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar Alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper â\\x80\\x9cAre you content nowâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar â\\x80\\x9cWell I should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mindâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cthree inches is such a wretched height to beâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt is a very good height indeedâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high) â\\x80\\x9cBut Iâ\\x80\\x99m not used to itâ\\x80\\x9d pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone And she thought of herself â\\x80\\x9cI wish the creatures wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be so easily offendedâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll get used to it in timeâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself Then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went â\\x80\\x9cOne side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorterâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOne side of what The other side of whatâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice to herself â\\x80\\x9cOf the mushroomâ\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question However at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand â\\x80\\x9cAnd now which is whichâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself and nibbled a little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit â\\x80\\x9cCome my headâ\\x80\\x99s free at lastâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her â\\x80\\x9cWhat can all that green stuff beâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cAnd where have my shoulders got to And oh my poor hands how is it I canâ\\x80\\x99t see youâ\\x80\\x9d She was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings â\\x80\\x9cSerpentâ\\x80\\x9d screamed the Pigeon â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not a serpentâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice indignantly â\\x80\\x9cLet me aloneâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSerpent I say againâ\\x80\\x9d repeated the Pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve tried every way and nothing seems to suit themâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t the least idea what youâ\\x80\\x99re talking aboutâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve tried the roots of trees and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve tried banks and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve tried hedgesâ\\x80\\x9d the Pigeon went on without attending to her â\\x80\\x9cbut those serpents Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no pleasing themâ\\x80\\x9d Alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished â\\x80\\x9cAs if it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t trouble enough hatching the eggsâ\\x80\\x9d said the Pigeon â\\x80\\x9cbut I must be on the lookout for serpents night and day Why I havenâ\\x80\\x99t had a wink of sleep these three weeksâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m very sorry youâ\\x80\\x99ve been annoyedâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice who was beginning to see its meaning â\\x80\\x9cAnd just as Iâ\\x80\\x99d taken the highest tree in the woodâ\\x80\\x9d continued the Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek â\\x80\\x9cand just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky Ugh Serpentâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a serpent I tell youâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m aâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m aâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell What are youâ\\x80\\x9d said the Pigeon â\\x80\\x9cI can see youâ\\x80\\x99re trying to invent somethingâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m a little girlâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day â\\x80\\x9cA likely story indeedâ\\x80\\x9d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that No no Youâ\\x80\\x99re a serpent and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no use denying it I suppose youâ\\x80\\x99ll be telling me next that you never tasted an eggâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI have tasted eggs certainlyâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice who was a very truthful child â\\x80\\x9cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you knowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe itâ\\x80\\x9d said the Pigeon â\\x80\\x9cbut if they do why then theyâ\\x80\\x99re a kind of serpent thatâ\\x80\\x99s all I can sayâ\\x80\\x9d This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re looking for eggs I know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youâ\\x80\\x99re a little girl or a serpentâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt matters a good deal to meâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice hastily â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99m not looking for eggs as it happens and if I was I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want yours I donâ\\x80\\x99t like them rawâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell be off thenâ\\x80\\x9d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual â\\x80\\x9cCome thereâ\\x80\\x99s half my plan done now How puzzling all these changes are Iâ\\x80\\x99m never sure what Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be from one minute to another However Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful gardenâ\\x80\\x94how is that to be done I wonderâ\\x80\\x9d As she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high â\\x80\\x9cWhoever lives thereâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99ll never do to come upon them this size why I should frighten them out of their witsâ\\x80\\x9d So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high CHAPTER VI Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodâ\\x80\\x94(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish)â\\x80\\x94and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles It was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen Alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads She felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen The FishFootman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone â\\x80\\x9cFor the Duchess An invitation from the Queen to play croquetâ\\x80\\x9d The FrogFootman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little â\\x80\\x9cFrom the Queen An invitation for the Duchess to play croquetâ\\x80\\x9d Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together Alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the FishFootman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no sort of use in knockingâ\\x80\\x9d said the Footman â\\x80\\x9cand that for two reasons First because Iâ\\x80\\x99m on the same side of the door as you are secondly because theyâ\\x80\\x99re making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear youâ\\x80\\x9d And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on withinâ\\x80\\x94a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces â\\x80\\x9cPlease thenâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9chow am I to get inâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThere might be some sense in your knockingâ\\x80\\x9d the Footman went on without attending to her â\\x80\\x9cif we had the door between us For instance if you were inside you might knock and I could let you out you knowâ\\x80\\x9d He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil â\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps he canâ\\x80\\x99t help itâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself â\\x80\\x9chis eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head But at any rate he might answer questionsâ\\x80\\x94How am I to get inâ\\x80\\x9d she repeated aloud â\\x80\\x9cI shall sit hereâ\\x80\\x9d the Footman remarked â\\x80\\x9ctill tomorrowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d At this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the Footmanâ\\x80\\x99s head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94or next day maybeâ\\x80\\x9d the Footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened â\\x80\\x9cHow am I to get inâ\\x80\\x9d asked Alice again in a louder tone â\\x80\\x9cAre you to get in at allâ\\x80\\x9d said the Footman â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the first question you knowâ\\x80\\x9d It was no doubt only Alice did not like to be told so â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s really dreadfulâ\\x80\\x9d she muttered to herself â\\x80\\x9cthe way all the creatures argue Itâ\\x80\\x99s enough to drive one crazyâ\\x80\\x9d The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations â\\x80\\x9cI shall sit hereâ\\x80\\x9d he said â\\x80\\x9con and off for days and daysâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut what am I to doâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cAnything you likeâ\\x80\\x9d said the Footman and began whistling â\\x80\\x9cOh thereâ\\x80\\x99s no use in talking to himâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice desperately â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s perfectly idioticâ\\x80\\x9d And she opened the door and went in The door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the Duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s certainly too much pepper in that soupâ\\x80\\x9d Alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing There was certainly too much of it in the air Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a momentâ\\x80\\x99s pause The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear â\\x80\\x9cPlease would you tell meâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first â\\x80\\x9cwhy your cat grins like thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a Cheshire catâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cand thatâ\\x80\\x99s why Pigâ\\x80\\x9d She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on againâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know that cats could grinâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThey all canâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cand most of â\\x80\\x99em doâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know of any that doâ\\x80\\x9d Alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t know muchâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cand thatâ\\x80\\x99s a factâ\\x80\\x9d Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation While she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the babyâ\\x80\\x94the fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not â\\x80\\x9cOh please mind what youâ\\x80\\x99re doingâ\\x80\\x9d cried Alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror â\\x80\\x9cOh there goes his precious noseâ\\x80\\x9d as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off â\\x80\\x9cIf everybody minded their own businessâ\\x80\\x9d the Duchess said in a hoarse growl â\\x80\\x9cthe world would go round a deal faster than it doesâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhich would not be an advantageâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge â\\x80\\x9cJust think of what work it would make with the day and night You see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axisâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTalking of axesâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cchop off her headâ\\x80\\x9d Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again â\\x80\\x9cTwentyfour hours I think or is it twelve Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh donâ\\x80\\x99t bother meâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cI never could abide figuresâ\\x80\\x9d And with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line â\\x80\\x9cSpeak roughly to your little boy And beat him when he sneezes He only does it to annoy Because he knows it teasesâ\\x80\\x9d CHORUS (In which the cook and the baby joined) â\\x80\\x9cWow wow wowâ\\x80\\x9d While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that Alice could hardly hear the wordsâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cI speak severely to my boy I beat him when he sneezes For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleasesâ\\x80\\x9d CHORUS â\\x80\\x9cWow wow wowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHere you may nurse it a bit if you likeâ\\x80\\x9d the Duchess said to Alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke â\\x80\\x9cI must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queenâ\\x80\\x9d and she hurried out of the room The cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out but it just missed her Alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queershaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions â\\x80\\x9cjust like a starfishâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice The poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself) she carried it out into the open air â\\x80\\x9cIf I donâ\\x80\\x99t take this child away with meâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be murder to leave it behindâ\\x80\\x9d She said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time) â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t gruntâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s not at all a proper way of expressing yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it There could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all â\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps it was only sobbingâ\\x80\\x9d she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears No there were no tears â\\x80\\x9cIf youâ\\x80\\x99re going to turn into a pig my dearâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice seriously â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll have nothing more to do with you Mind nowâ\\x80\\x9d The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted it was impossible to say which) and they went on for some while in silence Alice was just beginning to think to herself â\\x80\\x9cNow what am I to do with this creature when I get it homeâ\\x80\\x9d when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm This time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further So she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood â\\x80\\x9cIf it had grown upâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself â\\x80\\x9cit would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig I thinkâ\\x80\\x9d And she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself â\\x80\\x9cif one only knew the right way to change themâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice It looked goodnatured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect â\\x80\\x9cCheshire Pussâ\\x80\\x9d she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider â\\x80\\x9cCome itâ\\x80\\x99s pleased so farâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice and she went on â\\x80\\x9cWould you tell me please which way I ought to go from hereâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get toâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t much care whereâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cThen it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter which way you goâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94so long as I get somewhereâ\\x80\\x9d Alice added as an explanation â\\x80\\x9cOh youâ\\x80\\x99re sure to do thatâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat â\\x80\\x9cif you only walk long enoughâ\\x80\\x9d Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question â\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of people live about hereâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIn that directionâ\\x80\\x9d the Cat said waving its right paw round â\\x80\\x9clives a Hatter and in that directionâ\\x80\\x9d waving the other paw â\\x80\\x9clives a March Hare Visit either you like theyâ\\x80\\x99re both madâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to go among mad peopleâ\\x80\\x9d Alice remarked â\\x80\\x9cOh you canâ\\x80\\x99t help thatâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99re all mad here Iâ\\x80\\x99m mad Youâ\\x80\\x99re madâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHow do you know Iâ\\x80\\x99m madâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cYou must beâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat â\\x80\\x9cor you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have come hereâ\\x80\\x9d Alice didnâ\\x80\\x99t think that proved it at all however she went on â\\x80\\x9cAnd how do you know that youâ\\x80\\x99re madâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTo begin withâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat â\\x80\\x9ca dogâ\\x80\\x99s not mad You grant thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI suppose soâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cWell thenâ\\x80\\x9d the Cat went on â\\x80\\x9cyou see a dog growls when itâ\\x80\\x99s angry and wags its tail when itâ\\x80\\x99s pleased Now I growl when Iâ\\x80\\x99m pleased and wag my tail when Iâ\\x80\\x99m angry Therefore Iâ\\x80\\x99m madâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI call it purring not growlingâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cCall it what you likeâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat â\\x80\\x9cDo you play croquet with the Queen todayâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI should like it very muchâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cbut I havenâ\\x80\\x99t been invited yetâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll see me thereâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat and vanished Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening While she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again â\\x80\\x9cBythebye what became of the babyâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d nearly forgotten to askâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt turned into a pigâ\\x80\\x9d Alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way â\\x80\\x9cI thought it wouldâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat and vanished again Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen hatters beforeâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself â\\x80\\x9cthe March Hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is May it wonâ\\x80\\x99t be raving madâ\\x80\\x94at least not so mad as it was in Marchâ\\x80\\x9d As she said this she looked up and there was the Cat again sitting on a branch of a tree â\\x80\\x9cDid you say pig or figâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat â\\x80\\x9cI said pigâ\\x80\\x9d replied Alice â\\x80\\x9cand I wish you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAll rightâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone â\\x80\\x9cWell Iâ\\x80\\x99ve often seen a cat without a grinâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cbut a grin without a cat Itâ\\x80\\x99s the most curious thing I ever saw in my lifeâ\\x80\\x9d She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur It was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself â\\x80\\x9cSuppose it should be raving mad after all I almost wish Iâ\\x80\\x99d gone to see the Hatter insteadâ\\x80\\x9d CHAPTER VII A Mad TeaParty There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it a Dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head â\\x80\\x9cVery uncomfortable for the Dormouseâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9conly as itâ\\x80\\x99s asleep I suppose it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mindâ\\x80\\x9d The table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it â\\x80\\x9cNo room No roomâ\\x80\\x9d they cried out when they saw Alice coming â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s plenty of roomâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table â\\x80\\x9cHave some wineâ\\x80\\x9d the March Hare said in an encouraging tone Alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see any wineâ\\x80\\x9d she remarked â\\x80\\x9cThere isnâ\\x80\\x99t anyâ\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare â\\x80\\x9cThen it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t very civil of you to offer itâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice angrily â\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t very civil of you to sit down without being invitedâ\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t know it was your tableâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s laid for a great many more than threeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYour hair wants cuttingâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech â\\x80\\x9cYou should learn not to make personal remarksâ\\x80\\x9d Alice said with some severity â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s very rudeâ\\x80\\x9d The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was â\\x80\\x9cWhy is a raven like a writingdeskâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCome we shall have some fun nowâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m glad theyâ\\x80\\x99ve begun asking riddlesâ\\x80\\x94I believe I can guess thatâ\\x80\\x9d she added aloud â\\x80\\x9cDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to itâ\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare â\\x80\\x9cExactly soâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cThen you should say what you meanâ\\x80\\x9d the March Hare went on â\\x80\\x9cI doâ\\x80\\x9d Alice hastily replied â\\x80\\x9cat leastâ\\x80\\x94at least I mean what I sayâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the same thing you knowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNot the same thing a bitâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cYou might just as well say that â\\x80\\x98I see what I eatâ\\x80\\x99 is the same thing as â\\x80\\x98I eat what I seeâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou might just as well sayâ\\x80\\x9d added the March Hare â\\x80\\x9cthat â\\x80\\x98I like what I getâ\\x80\\x99 is the same thing as â\\x80\\x98I get what I likeâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou might just as well sayâ\\x80\\x9d added the Dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep â\\x80\\x9cthat â\\x80\\x98I breathe when I sleepâ\\x80\\x99 is the same thing as â\\x80\\x98I sleep when I breatheâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt is the same thing with youâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writingdesks which wasnâ\\x80\\x99t much The Hatter was the first to break the silence â\\x80\\x9cWhat day of the month is itâ\\x80\\x9d he said turning to Alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear Alice considered a little and then said â\\x80\\x9cThe fourthâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTwo days wrongâ\\x80\\x9d sighed the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cI told you butter wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t suit the worksâ\\x80\\x9d he added looking angrily at the March Hare â\\x80\\x9cIt was the best butterâ\\x80\\x9d the March Hare meekly replied â\\x80\\x9cYes but some crumbs must have got in as wellâ\\x80\\x9d the Hatter grumbled â\\x80\\x9cyou shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have put it in with the breadknifeâ\\x80\\x9d The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark â\\x80\\x9cIt was the best butter you knowâ\\x80\\x9d Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity â\\x80\\x9cWhat a funny watchâ\\x80\\x9d she remarked â\\x80\\x9cIt tells the day of the month and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t tell what oâ\\x80\\x99clock it isâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhy should itâ\\x80\\x9d muttered the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cDoes your watch tell you what year it isâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOf course notâ\\x80\\x9d Alice replied very readily â\\x80\\x9cbut thatâ\\x80\\x99s because it stays the same year for such a long time togetherâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhich is just the case with mineâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter Alice felt dreadfully puzzled The Hatterâ\\x80\\x99s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly English â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t quite understand youâ\\x80\\x9d she said as politely as she could â\\x80\\x9cThe Dormouse is asleep againâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose The Dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes â\\x80\\x9cOf course of course just what I was going to remark myselfâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHave you guessed the riddle yetâ\\x80\\x9d the Hatter said turning to Alice again â\\x80\\x9cNo I give it upâ\\x80\\x9d Alice replied â\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s the answerâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t the slightest ideaâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cNor Iâ\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare Alice sighed wearily â\\x80\\x9cI think you might do something better with the timeâ\\x80\\x9d she said â\\x80\\x9cthan waste it in asking riddles that have no answersâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf you knew Time as well as I doâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cyou wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t talk about wasting it Itâ\\x80\\x99s himâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you meanâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cOf course you donâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d the Hatter said tossing his head contemptuously â\\x80\\x9cI dare say you never even spoke to Timeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps notâ\\x80\\x9d Alice cautiously replied â\\x80\\x9cbut I know I have to beat time when I learn musicâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAh that accounts for itâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cHe wonâ\\x80\\x99t stand beating Now if you only kept on good terms with him heâ\\x80\\x99d do almost anything you liked with the clock For instance suppose it were nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning just time to begin lessons youâ\\x80\\x99d only have to whisper a hint to Time and round goes the clock in a twinkling Halfpast one time for dinnerâ\\x80\\x9d (â\\x80\\x9cI only wish it wasâ\\x80\\x9d the March Hare said to itself in a whisper) â\\x80\\x9cThat would be grand certainlyâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice thoughtfully â\\x80\\x9cbut thenâ\\x80\\x94I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be hungry for it you knowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNot at first perhapsâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cbut you could keep it to halfpast one as long as you likedâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIs that the way you manageâ\\x80\\x9d Alice asked The Hatter shook his head mournfully â\\x80\\x9cNot Iâ\\x80\\x9d he replied â\\x80\\x9cWe quarrelled last Marchâ\\x80\\x94just before he went mad you knowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare) â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing â\\x80\\x98Twinkle twinkle little bat How I wonder what youâ\\x80\\x99re atâ\\x80\\x99 You know the song perhapsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve heard something like itâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cIt goes on you knowâ\\x80\\x9d the Hatter continued â\\x80\\x9cin this wayâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Up above the world you fly Like a teatray in the sky Twinkle twinkleâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Here the Dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep â\\x80\\x9cTwinkle twinkle twinkle twinkleâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop â\\x80\\x9cWell Iâ\\x80\\x99d hardly finished the first verseâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cwhen the Queen jumped up and bawled out â\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s murdering the time Off with his headâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHow dreadfully savageâ\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Alice â\\x80\\x9cAnd ever since thatâ\\x80\\x9d the Hatter went on in a mournful tone â\\x80\\x9che wonâ\\x80\\x99t do a thing I ask Itâ\\x80\\x99s always six oâ\\x80\\x99clock nowâ\\x80\\x9d A bright idea came into Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s head â\\x80\\x9cIs that the reason so many teathings are put out hereâ\\x80\\x9d she asked â\\x80\\x9cYes thatâ\\x80\\x99s itâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter with a sigh â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s always teatime and weâ\\x80\\x99ve no time to wash the things between whilesâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThen you keep moving round I supposeâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cExactly soâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cas the things get used upâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut what happens when you come to the beginning againâ\\x80\\x9d Alice ventured to ask â\\x80\\x9cSuppose we change the subjectâ\\x80\\x9d the March Hare interrupted yawning â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m getting tired of this I vote the young lady tells us a storyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid I donâ\\x80\\x99t know oneâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice rather alarmed at the proposal â\\x80\\x9cThen the Dormouse shallâ\\x80\\x9d they both cried â\\x80\\x9cWake up Dormouseâ\\x80\\x9d And they pinched it on both sides at once The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes â\\x80\\x9cI wasnâ\\x80\\x99t asleepâ\\x80\\x9d he said in a hoarse feeble voice â\\x80\\x9cI heard every word you fellows were sayingâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTell us a storyâ\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare â\\x80\\x9cYes please doâ\\x80\\x9d pleaded Alice â\\x80\\x9cAnd be quick about itâ\\x80\\x9d added the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cor youâ\\x80\\x99ll be asleep again before itâ\\x80\\x99s doneâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOnce upon a time there were three little sistersâ\\x80\\x9d the Dormouse began in a great hurry â\\x80\\x9cand their names were Elsie Lacie and Tillie and they lived at the bottom of a wellâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat did they live onâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking â\\x80\\x9cThey lived on treacleâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse after thinking a minute or two â\\x80\\x9cThey couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have done that you knowâ\\x80\\x9d Alice gently remarked â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99d have been illâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSo they wereâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse â\\x80\\x9cvery illâ\\x80\\x9d Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on â\\x80\\x9cBut why did they live at the bottom of a wellâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTake some more teaâ\\x80\\x9d the March Hare said to Alice very earnestly â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve had nothing yetâ\\x80\\x9d Alice replied in an offended tone â\\x80\\x9cso I canâ\\x80\\x99t take moreâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou mean you canâ\\x80\\x99t take lessâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s very easy to take more than nothingâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNobody asked your opinionâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cWhoâ\\x80\\x99s making personal remarks nowâ\\x80\\x9d the Hatter asked triumphantly Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the Dormouse and repeated her question â\\x80\\x9cWhy did they live at the bottom of a wellâ\\x80\\x9d The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said â\\x80\\x9cIt was a treaclewellâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no such thingâ\\x80\\x9d Alice was beginning very angrily but the Hatter and the March Hare went â\\x80\\x9cSh shâ\\x80\\x9d and the Dormouse sulkily remarked â\\x80\\x9cIf you canâ\\x80\\x99t be civil youâ\\x80\\x99d better finish the story for yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo please go onâ\\x80\\x9d Alice said very humbly â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t interrupt again I dare say there may be oneâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOne indeedâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse indignantly However he consented to go on â\\x80\\x9cAnd so these three little sistersâ\\x80\\x94they were learning to draw you knowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat did they drawâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice quite forgetting her promise â\\x80\\x9cTreacleâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse without considering at all this time â\\x80\\x9cI want a clean cupâ\\x80\\x9d interrupted the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s all move one place onâ\\x80\\x9d He moved on as he spoke and the Dormouse followed him the March Hare moved into the Dormouseâ\\x80\\x99s place and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and Alice was a good deal worse off than before as the March Hare had just upset the milkjug into his plate Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again so she began very cautiously â\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand Where did they draw the treacle fromâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou can draw water out of a waterwellâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cso I should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewellâ\\x80\\x94eh stupidâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut they were in the wellâ\\x80\\x9d Alice said to the Dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark â\\x80\\x9cOf course they wereâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94well inâ\\x80\\x9d This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it â\\x80\\x9cThey were learning to drawâ\\x80\\x9d the Dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy â\\x80\\x9cand they drew all manner of thingsâ\\x80\\x94everything that begins with an Mâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhy with an Mâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cWhy notâ\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare Alice was silent The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94that begins with an M such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchnessâ\\x80\\x94you know you say things are â\\x80\\x9cmuch of a muchnessâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchnessâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cReally now you ask meâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice very much confused â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t thinkâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThen you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t talkâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot â\\x80\\x9cAt any rate Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never go there againâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice as she picked her way through the wood â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the stupidest teaparty I ever was at in all my lifeâ\\x80\\x9d Just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s very curiousâ\\x80\\x9d she thought â\\x80\\x9cBut everythingâ\\x80\\x99s curious today I think I may as well go in at onceâ\\x80\\x9d And in she went Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table â\\x80\\x9cNow Iâ\\x80\\x99ll manage better this timeâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and thenâ\\x80\\x94she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains CHAPTER VIII The Queenâ\\x80\\x99s CroquetGround A large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red Alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say â\\x80\\x9cLook out now Five Donâ\\x80\\x99t go splashing paint over me like thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t help itâ\\x80\\x9d said Five in a sulky tone â\\x80\\x9cSeven jogged my elbowâ\\x80\\x9d On which Seven looked up and said â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right Five Always lay the blame on othersâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better not talkâ\\x80\\x9d said Five â\\x80\\x9cI heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheadedâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat forâ\\x80\\x9d said the one who had spoken first â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s none of your business Twoâ\\x80\\x9d said Seven â\\x80\\x9cYes it is his businessâ\\x80\\x9d said Five â\\x80\\x9cand Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell himâ\\x80\\x94it was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onionsâ\\x80\\x9d Seven flung down his brush and had just begun â\\x80\\x9cWell of all the unjust thingsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low â\\x80\\x9cWould you tell meâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice a little timidly â\\x80\\x9cwhy you are painting those rosesâ\\x80\\x9d Five and Seven said nothing but looked at Two Two began in a low voice â\\x80\\x9cWhy the fact is you see Miss this here ought to have been a red rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the Queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know So you see Miss weâ\\x80\\x99re doing our best afore she comes toâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d At this moment Five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out â\\x80\\x9cThe Queen The Queenâ\\x80\\x9d and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice looked round eager to see the Queen First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did After these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts Next came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the Kingâ\\x80\\x99s crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions â\\x80\\x9cand besides what would be the use of a processionâ\\x80\\x9d thought she â\\x80\\x9cif people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see itâ\\x80\\x9d So she stood still where she was and waited When the procession came opposite to Alice they all stopped and looked at her and the Queen said severely â\\x80\\x9cWho is thisâ\\x80\\x9d She said it to the Knave of Hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply â\\x80\\x9cIdiotâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to Alice she went on â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s your name childâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMy name is Alice so please your Majestyâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice very politely but she added to herself â\\x80\\x9cWhy theyâ\\x80\\x99re only a pack of cards after all I neednâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid of themâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd who are theseâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children â\\x80\\x9cHow should I knowâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice surprised at her own courage â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no business of mineâ\\x80\\x9d The Queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed â\\x80\\x9cOff with her head Offâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNonsenseâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice very loudly and decidedly and the Queen was silent The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said â\\x80\\x9cConsider my dear she is only a childâ\\x80\\x9d The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave â\\x80\\x9cTurn them overâ\\x80\\x9d The Knave did so very carefully with one foot â\\x80\\x9cGet upâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the King the Queen the royal children and everybody else â\\x80\\x9cLeave off thatâ\\x80\\x9d screamed the Queen â\\x80\\x9cYou make me giddyâ\\x80\\x9d And then turning to the rosetree she went on â\\x80\\x9cWhat have you been doing hereâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMay it please your Majestyâ\\x80\\x9d said Two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke â\\x80\\x9cwe were tryingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI seeâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses â\\x80\\x9cOff with their headsâ\\x80\\x9d and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to Alice for protection â\\x80\\x9cYou shanâ\\x80\\x99t be beheadedâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice and she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others â\\x80\\x9cAre their heads offâ\\x80\\x9d shouted the Queen â\\x80\\x9cTheir heads are gone if it please your Majestyâ\\x80\\x9d the soldiers shouted in reply â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s rightâ\\x80\\x9d shouted the Queen â\\x80\\x9cCan you play croquetâ\\x80\\x9d The soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question was evidently meant for her â\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x9d shouted Alice â\\x80\\x9cCome on thenâ\\x80\\x9d roared the Queen and Alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s a very fine dayâ\\x80\\x9d said a timid voice at her side She was walking by the White Rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face â\\x80\\x9cVeryâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94whereâ\\x80\\x99s the Duchessâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHush Hushâ\\x80\\x9d said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s under sentence of executionâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat forâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cDid you say â\\x80\\x98What a pityâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d the Rabbit asked â\\x80\\x9cNo I didnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think itâ\\x80\\x99s at all a pity I said â\\x80\\x98What forâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cShe boxed the Queenâ\\x80\\x99s earsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d the Rabbit began Alice gave a little scream of laughter â\\x80\\x9cOh hushâ\\x80\\x9d the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone â\\x80\\x9cThe Queen will hear you You see she came rather late and the Queen saidâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cGet to your placesâ\\x80\\x9d shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed The players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting â\\x80\\x9cOff with his headâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cOff with her headâ\\x80\\x9d about once in a minute Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen but she knew that it might happen any minute â\\x80\\x9cand thenâ\\x80\\x9d thought she â\\x80\\x9cwhat would become of me Theyâ\\x80\\x99re dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that thereâ\\x80\\x99s any one left aliveâ\\x80\\x9d She was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the Cheshire Cat now I shall have somebody to talk toâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHow are you getting onâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with Alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no use speaking to itâ\\x80\\x9d she thought â\\x80\\x9ctill its ears have come or at least one of themâ\\x80\\x9d In another minute the whole head appeared and then Alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think they play at all fairlyâ\\x80\\x9d Alice began in rather a complaining tone â\\x80\\x9cand they all quarrel so dreadfully one canâ\\x80\\x99t hear oneself speakâ\\x80\\x94and they donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to themâ\\x80\\x94and youâ\\x80\\x99ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance thereâ\\x80\\x99s the arch Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundâ\\x80\\x94and I should have croqueted the Queenâ\\x80\\x99s hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine comingâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHow do you like the Queenâ\\x80\\x9d said the Cat in a low voice â\\x80\\x9cNot at allâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9csheâ\\x80\\x99s so extremelyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her listening so she went on â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94likely to win that itâ\\x80\\x99s hardly worth while finishing the gameâ\\x80\\x9d The Queen smiled and passed on â\\x80\\x9cWho are you talking toâ\\x80\\x9d said the King going up to Alice and looking at the Catâ\\x80\\x99s head with great curiosity â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a friend of mineâ\\x80\\x94a Cheshire Catâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9callow me to introduce itâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t like the look of it at allâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9chowever it may kiss my hand if it likesâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d rather notâ\\x80\\x9d the Cat remarked â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be impertinentâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cand donâ\\x80\\x99t look at me like thatâ\\x80\\x9d He got behind Alice as he spoke â\\x80\\x9cA cat may look at a kingâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve read that in some book but I donâ\\x80\\x99t remember whereâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell it must be removedâ\\x80\\x9d said the King very decidedly and he called the Queen who was passing at the moment â\\x80\\x9cMy dear I wish you would have this cat removedâ\\x80\\x9d The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small â\\x80\\x9cOff with his headâ\\x80\\x9d she said without even looking round â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll fetch the executioner myselfâ\\x80\\x9d said the King eagerly and he hurried off Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the Queenâ\\x80\\x99s voice in the distance screaming with passion She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not So she went in search of her hedgehog The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight â\\x80\\x9cbut it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter muchâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cas all the arches are gone from this side of the groundâ\\x80\\x9d So she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend When she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the King and the Queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said The executionerâ\\x80\\x99s argument was that you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t going to begin at his time of life The Kingâ\\x80\\x99s argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you werenâ\\x80\\x99t to talk nonsense The Queenâ\\x80\\x99s argument was that if something wasnâ\\x80\\x99t done about it in less than no time sheâ\\x80\\x99d have everybody executed all round (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious) Alice could think of nothing else to say but â\\x80\\x9cIt belongs to the Duchess youâ\\x80\\x99d better ask her about itâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s in prisonâ\\x80\\x9d the Queen said to the executioner â\\x80\\x9cfetch her hereâ\\x80\\x9d And the executioner went off like an arrow The Catâ\\x80\\x99s head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the Duchess it had entirely disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game CHAPTER IX The Mock Turtleâ\\x80\\x99s Story â\\x80\\x9cYou canâ\\x80\\x99t think how glad I am to see you again you dear old thingâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s and they walked off together Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen â\\x80\\x9cWhen Iâ\\x80\\x99m a Duchessâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself (not in a very hopeful tone though) â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t have any pepper in my kitchen at all Soup does very well withoutâ\\x80\\x94Maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s always pepper that makes people hottemperedâ\\x80\\x9d she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule â\\x80\\x9cand vinegar that makes them sourâ\\x80\\x94and camomile that makes them bitterâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94and barleysugar and such things that make children sweettempered I only wish people knew that then they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be so stingy about it you knowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you just now what the moral of that is but I shall remember it in a bitâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it hasnâ\\x80\\x99t oneâ\\x80\\x9d Alice ventured to remark â\\x80\\x9cTut tut childâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cEverythingâ\\x80\\x99s got a moral if only you can find itâ\\x80\\x9d And she squeezed herself up closer to Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s side as she spoke Alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the Duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin However she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could â\\x80\\x9cThe gameâ\\x80\\x99s going on rather better nowâ\\x80\\x9d she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis soâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cand the moral of that isâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Oh â\\x80\\x99tis love â\\x80\\x99tis love that makes the world go roundâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSomebody saidâ\\x80\\x9d Alice whispered â\\x80\\x9cthat itâ\\x80\\x99s done by everybody minding their own businessâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAh well It means much the same thingâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess digging her sharp little chin into Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder as she added â\\x80\\x9cand the moral of that isâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselvesâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHow fond she is of finding morals in thingsâ\\x80\\x9d Alice thought to herself â\\x80\\x9cI dare say youâ\\x80\\x99re wondering why I donâ\\x80\\x99t put my arm round your waistâ\\x80\\x9d the Duchess said after a pause â\\x80\\x9cthe reason is that Iâ\\x80\\x99m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo Shall I try the experimentâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHe might biteâ\\x80\\x9d Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried â\\x80\\x9cVery trueâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cflamingoes and mustard both bite And the moral of that isâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Birds of a feather flock togetherâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOnly mustard isnâ\\x80\\x99t a birdâ\\x80\\x9d Alice remarked â\\x80\\x9cRight as usualâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cwhat a clear way you have of putting thingsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a mineral I thinkâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cOf course it isâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s a large mustardmine near here And the moral of that isâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98The more there is of mine the less there is of yoursâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh I knowâ\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Alice who had not attended to this last remark â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a vegetable It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look like one but it isâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI quite agree with youâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cand the moral of that isâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Be what you would seem to beâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94or if youâ\\x80\\x99d like it put more simplyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwiseâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI think I should understand that betterâ\\x80\\x9d Alice said very politely â\\x80\\x9cif I had it written down but I canâ\\x80\\x99t quite follow it as you say itâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s nothing to what I could say if I choseâ\\x80\\x9d the Duchess replied in a pleased tone â\\x80\\x9cPray donâ\\x80\\x99t trouble yourself to say it any longer than thatâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cOh donâ\\x80\\x99t talk about troubleâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cI make you a present of everything Iâ\\x80\\x99ve said as yetâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA cheap sort of presentâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m glad they donâ\\x80\\x99t give birthday presents like thatâ\\x80\\x9d But she did not venture to say it out loud â\\x80\\x9cThinking againâ\\x80\\x9d the Duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve a right to thinkâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried â\\x80\\x9cJust about as much rightâ\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess â\\x80\\x9cas pigs have to fly and the mâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d But here to Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s great surprise the Duchessâ\\x80\\x99s voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word â\\x80\\x98moralâ\\x80\\x99 and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm â\\x80\\x9cA fine day your Majestyâ\\x80\\x9d the Duchess began in a low weak voice â\\x80\\x9cNow I give you fair warningâ\\x80\\x9d shouted the Queen stamping on the ground as she spoke â\\x80\\x9ceither you or your head must be off and that in about half no time Take your choiceâ\\x80\\x9d The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment â\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s go on with the gameâ\\x80\\x9d the Queen said to Alice and Alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquetground The other guests had taken advantage of the Queenâ\\x80\\x99s absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the Queen merely remarking that a momentâ\\x80\\x99s delay would cost them their lives All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting â\\x80\\x9cOff with his headâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cOff with her headâ\\x80\\x9d Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the King the Queen and Alice were in custody and under sentence of execution Then the Queen left off quite out of breath and said to Alice â\\x80\\x9cHave you seen the Mock Turtle yetâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t even know what a Mock Turtle isâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made fromâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen â\\x80\\x9cI never saw one or heard of oneâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cCome on thenâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen â\\x80\\x9cand he shall tell you his historyâ\\x80\\x9d As they walked off together Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally â\\x80\\x9cYou are all pardonedâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCome thatâ\\x80\\x99s a good thingâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered They very soon came upon a Gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun (If you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what a Gryphon is look at the picture) â\\x80\\x9cUp lazy thingâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen â\\x80\\x9cand take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle and to hear his history I must go back and see after some executions I have orderedâ\\x80\\x9d and she walked off leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon Alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen so she waited The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled â\\x80\\x9cWhat funâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon half to itself half to Alice â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the funâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cWhy sheâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know Come onâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cEverybody says â\\x80\\x98come onâ\\x80\\x99 hereâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice as she went slowly after it â\\x80\\x9cI never was so ordered about in all my life neverâ\\x80\\x9d They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break She pitied him deeply â\\x80\\x9cWhat is his sorrowâ\\x80\\x9d she asked the Gryphon and the Gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all his fancy that he hasnâ\\x80\\x99t got no sorrow you know Come onâ\\x80\\x9d So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing â\\x80\\x9cThis here young ladyâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cshe wants for to know your history she doâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell it herâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle in a deep hollow tone â\\x80\\x9csit down both of you and donâ\\x80\\x99t speak a word till Iâ\\x80\\x99ve finishedâ\\x80\\x9d So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes Alice thought to herself â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see how he can ever finish if he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t beginâ\\x80\\x9d But she waited patiently â\\x80\\x9cOnceâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh â\\x80\\x9cI was a real Turtleâ\\x80\\x9d These words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of â\\x80\\x9cHjckrrhâ\\x80\\x9d from the Gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle Alice was very nearly getting up and saying â\\x80\\x9cThank you sir for your interesting storyâ\\x80\\x9d but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing â\\x80\\x9cWhen we were littleâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then â\\x80\\x9cwe went to school in the sea The master was an old Turtleâ\\x80\\x94we used to call him Tortoiseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhy did you call him Tortoise if he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t oneâ\\x80\\x9d Alice asked â\\x80\\x9cWe called him Tortoise because he taught usâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle angrily â\\x80\\x9creally you are very dullâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple questionâ\\x80\\x9d added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cDrive on old fellow Donâ\\x80\\x99t be all day about itâ\\x80\\x9d and he went on in these words â\\x80\\x9cYes we went to school in the sea though you maynâ\\x80\\x99t believe itâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI never said I didnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d interrupted Alice â\\x80\\x9cYou didâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cHold your tongueâ\\x80\\x9d added the Gryphon before Alice could speak again The Mock Turtle went on â\\x80\\x9cWe had the best of educationsâ\\x80\\x94in fact we went to school every dayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been to a dayschool tooâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cyou neednâ\\x80\\x99t be so proud as all thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWith extrasâ\\x80\\x9d asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously â\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cwe learned French and musicâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd washingâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cCertainly notâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice indignantly â\\x80\\x9cAh then yours wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a really good schoolâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief â\\x80\\x9cNow at ours they had at the end of the bill â\\x80\\x98French music and washingâ\\x80\\x94extraâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have wanted it muchâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cliving at the bottom of the seaâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t afford to learn itâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle with a sigh â\\x80\\x9cI only took the regular courseâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat was thatâ\\x80\\x9d inquired Alice â\\x80\\x9cReeling and Writhing of course to begin withâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle replied â\\x80\\x9cand then the different branches of Arithmeticâ\\x80\\x94Ambition Distraction Uglification and Derisionâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI never heard of â\\x80\\x98Uglificationâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Alice ventured to say â\\x80\\x9cWhat is itâ\\x80\\x9d The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise â\\x80\\x9cWhat Never heard of uglifyingâ\\x80\\x9d it exclaimed â\\x80\\x9cYou know what to beautify is I supposeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice doubtfully â\\x80\\x9cit meansâ\\x80\\x94toâ\\x80\\x94makeâ\\x80\\x94anythingâ\\x80\\x94prettierâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell thenâ\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon went on â\\x80\\x9cif you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to uglify is you are a simpletonâ\\x80\\x9d Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the Mock Turtle and said â\\x80\\x9cWhat else had you to learnâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell there was Mysteryâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94Mystery ancient and modern with Seaography then Drawlingâ\\x80\\x94the Drawlingmaster was an old congereel that used to come once a week he taught us Drawling Stretching and Fainting in Coilsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat was that likeâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cWell I canâ\\x80\\x99t show it you myselfâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle said â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m too stiff And the Gryphon never learnt itâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHadnâ\\x80\\x99t timeâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cI went to the Classics master though He was an old crab he wasâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI never went to himâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle said with a sigh â\\x80\\x9che taught Laughing and Grief they used to sayâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSo he did so he didâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws â\\x80\\x9cAnd how many hours a day did you do lessonsâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a hurry to change the subject â\\x80\\x9cTen hours the first dayâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cnine the next and so onâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat a curious planâ\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Alice â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the reason theyâ\\x80\\x99re called lessonsâ\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon remarked â\\x80\\x9cbecause they lessen from day to dayâ\\x80\\x9d This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark â\\x80\\x9cThen the eleventh day must have been a holidayâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOf course it wasâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cAnd how did you manage on the twelfthâ\\x80\\x9d Alice went on eagerly â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s enough about lessonsâ\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone â\\x80\\x9ctell her something about the games nowâ\\x80\\x9d CHAPTER X The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes He looked at Alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice â\\x80\\x9cSame as if he had a bone in his throatâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on againâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cYou may not have lived much under the seaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d (â\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice)â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobsterâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d (Alice began to say â\\x80\\x9cI once tastedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d but checked herself hastily and said â\\x80\\x9cNo neverâ\\x80\\x9d) â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille isâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo indeedâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of a dance is itâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhyâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cyou first form into a line along the seashoreâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTwo linesâ\\x80\\x9d cried the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cSeals turtles salmon and so on then when youâ\\x80\\x99ve cleared all the jellyfish out of the wayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat generally takes some timeâ\\x80\\x9d interrupted the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94you advance twiceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cEach with a lobster as a partnerâ\\x80\\x9d cried the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cOf courseâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle said â\\x80\\x9cadvance twice set to partnersâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94change lobsters and retire in same orderâ\\x80\\x9d continued the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cThen you knowâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle went on â\\x80\\x9cyou throw theâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe lobstersâ\\x80\\x9d shouted the Gryphon with a bound into the air â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94as far out to sea as you canâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSwim after themâ\\x80\\x9d screamed the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cTurn a somersault in the seaâ\\x80\\x9d cried the Mock Turtle capering wildly about â\\x80\\x9cChange lobsters againâ\\x80\\x9d yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice â\\x80\\x9cBack to land again and thatâ\\x80\\x99s all the first figureâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at Alice â\\x80\\x9cIt must be a very pretty danceâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice timidly â\\x80\\x9cWould you like to see a little of itâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cVery much indeedâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cCome letâ\\x80\\x99s try the first figureâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cWe can do without lobsters you know Which shall singâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh you singâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve forgotten the wordsâ\\x80\\x9d So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the Mock Turtle sang this very slowly and sadlyâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cWill you walk a little fasterâ\\x80\\x9d said a whiting to a snail â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a porpoise close behind us and heâ\\x80\\x99s treading on my tail See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance They are waiting on the shingleâ\\x80\\x94will you come and join the dance Will you wonâ\\x80\\x99t you will you wonâ\\x80\\x99t you will you join the dance Will you wonâ\\x80\\x99t you will you wonâ\\x80\\x99t you wonâ\\x80\\x99t you join the dance â\\x80\\x9cYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to seaâ\\x80\\x9d But the snail replied â\\x80\\x9cToo far too farâ\\x80\\x9d and gave a look askanceâ\\x80\\x94 Said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance Would not could not would not could not would not join the dance Would not could not would not could not could not join the dance â\\x80\\x9cWhat matters it how far we goâ\\x80\\x9d his scaly friend replied â\\x80\\x9cThere is another shore you know upon the other side The further off from England the nearer is to Franceâ\\x80\\x94 Then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance Will you wonâ\\x80\\x99t you will you wonâ\\x80\\x99t you will you join the dance Will you wonâ\\x80\\x99t you will you wonâ\\x80\\x99t you wonâ\\x80\\x99t you join the danceâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThank you itâ\\x80\\x99s a very interesting dance to watchâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice feeling very glad that it was over at last â\\x80\\x9cand I do so like that curious song about the whitingâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh as to the whitingâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ve seen them of courseâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve often seen them at dinnâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d she checked herself hastily â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know where Dinn may beâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cbut if youâ\\x80\\x99ve seen them so often of course you know what theyâ\\x80\\x99re likeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI believe soâ\\x80\\x9d Alice replied thoughtfully â\\x80\\x9cThey have their tails in their mouthsâ\\x80\\x94and theyâ\\x80\\x99re all over crumbsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re wrong about the crumbsâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9ccrumbs would all wash off in the sea But they have their tails in their mouths and the reason isâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cTell her about the reason and all thatâ\\x80\\x9d he said to the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cThe reason isâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cthat they would go with the lobsters to the dance So they got thrown out to sea So they had to fall a long way So they got their tails fast in their mouths So they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get them out again Thatâ\\x80\\x99s allâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThank youâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s very interesting I never knew so much about a whiting beforeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI can tell you more than that if you likeâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cDo you know why itâ\\x80\\x99s called a whitingâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI never thought about itâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cWhyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt does the boots and shoesâ\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon replied very solemnly Alice was thoroughly puzzled â\\x80\\x9cDoes the boots and shoesâ\\x80\\x9d she repeated in a wondering tone â\\x80\\x9cWhy what are your shoes done withâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cI mean what makes them so shinyâ\\x80\\x9d Alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re done with blacking I believeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBoots and shoes under the seaâ\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon went on in a deep voice â\\x80\\x9care done with a whiting Now you knowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd what are they made ofâ\\x80\\x9d Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity â\\x80\\x9cSoles and eels of courseâ\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon replied rather impatiently â\\x80\\x9cany shrimp could have told you thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf Iâ\\x80\\x99d been the whitingâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice whose thoughts were still running on the song â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d have said to the porpoise â\\x80\\x98Keep back please we donâ\\x80\\x99t want you with usâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThey were obliged to have him with themâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle said â\\x80\\x9cno wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoiseâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it reallyâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a tone of great surprise â\\x80\\x9cOf course notâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cwhy if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey I should say â\\x80\\x98With what porpoiseâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you mean â\\x80\\x98purposeâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cI mean what I sayâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone And the Gryphon added â\\x80\\x9cCome letâ\\x80\\x99s hear some of your adventuresâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI could tell you my adventuresâ\\x80\\x94beginning from this morningâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice a little timidly â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s no use going back to yesterday because I was a different person thenâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cExplain all thatâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cNo no The adventures firstâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon in an impatient tone â\\x80\\x9cexplanations take such a dreadful timeâ\\x80\\x9d So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit She was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating â\\x80\\x9cYou are old Father Williamâ\\x80\\x9d to the Caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath and said â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s very curiousâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all about as curious as it can beâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cIt all came differentâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully â\\x80\\x9cI should like to hear her try and repeat something now Tell her to beginâ\\x80\\x9d He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice â\\x80\\x9cStand up and repeat â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99Tis the voice of the sluggardâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cHow the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessonsâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cI might as well be at school at onceâ\\x80\\x9d However she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeedâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare â\\x80\\x9cYou have baked me too brown I must sugar my hairâ\\x80\\x9d As a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toesâ\\x80\\x9d [later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark But when the tide rises and sharks are around His voice has a timid and tremulous sound] â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s different from what I used to say when I was a childâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cWell I never heard it beforeâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cbut it sounds uncommon nonsenseâ\\x80\\x9d Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again â\\x80\\x9cI should like to have it explainedâ\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle â\\x80\\x9cShe canâ\\x80\\x99t explain itâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon hastily â\\x80\\x9cGo on with the next verseâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut about his toesâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle persisted â\\x80\\x9cHow could he turn them out with his nose you knowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the first position in dancingâ\\x80\\x9d Alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject â\\x80\\x9cGo on with the next verseâ\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon repeated impatiently â\\x80\\x9cit begins â\\x80\\x98I passed by his gardenâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voiceâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cI passed by his garden and marked with one eye How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pieâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d [later editions continued as follows The Panther took piecrust and gravy and meat While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat When the pie was all finished the Owl as a boon Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl And concluded the banquetâ\\x80\\x94] â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the use of repeating all that stuffâ\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle interrupted â\\x80\\x9cif you donâ\\x80\\x99t explain it as you go on Itâ\\x80\\x99s by far the most confusing thing I ever heardâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes I think youâ\\x80\\x99d better leave offâ\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon and Alice was only too glad to do so â\\x80\\x9cShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrilleâ\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon went on â\\x80\\x9cOr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a songâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh a song please if the Mock Turtle would be so kindâ\\x80\\x9d Alice replied so eagerly that the Gryphon said in a rather offended tone â\\x80\\x9cHm No accounting for tastes Sing her â\\x80\\x98Turtle Soupâ\\x80\\x99 will you old fellowâ\\x80\\x9d The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing thisâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cBeautiful Soup so rich and green Waiting in a hot tureen Who for such dainties would not stoop Soup of the evening beautiful Soup Soup of the evening beautiful Soup Beauâ\\x80\\x94ootiful Sooâ\\x80\\x94oop Beauâ\\x80\\x94ootiful Sooâ\\x80\\x94oop

beginningâ\\x80\\x9d was heard in the distance â\\x80\\x9cCome onâ\\x80\\x9d cried the Gryphon and taking Alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song â\\x80\\x9cWhat trial is itâ\\x80\\x9d Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon only answered â\\x80\\x9cCome onâ\\x80\\x9d and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy wordsâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cSooâ\\x80\\x94oop of the eâ\\x80\\x94eâ\\x80\\x94evening Beautiful beautiful Soupâ\\x80\\x9d CHAPTER XI Who Stole the Tarts The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themâ\\x80\\x94all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the Knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other In the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cI wish theyâ\\x80\\x99d get the trial doneâ\\x80\\x9d she thought â\\x80\\x9cand hand round the refreshmentsâ\\x80\\x9d But there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time Alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the judgeâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself â\\x80\\x9cbecause of his great wigâ\\x80\\x9d The judge by the way was the King and as he wore his crown over the wig (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it) he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming â\\x80\\x9cAnd thatâ\\x80\\x99s the juryboxâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cand those twelve creaturesâ\\x80\\x9d (she was obliged to say â\\x80\\x9ccreaturesâ\\x80\\x9d you see because some of them were animals and some were birds) â\\x80\\x9cI suppose they are the jurorsâ\\x80\\x9d She said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all However â\\x80\\x9cjurymenâ\\x80\\x9d would have done just as well The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates â\\x80\\x9cWhat are they doingâ\\x80\\x9d Alice whispered to the Gryphon â\\x80\\x9cThey canâ\\x80\\x99t have anything to put down yet before the trialâ\\x80\\x99s begunâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re putting down their namesâ\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon whispered in reply â\\x80\\x9cfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trialâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cStupid thingsâ\\x80\\x9d Alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the White Rabbit cried out â\\x80\\x9cSilence in the courtâ\\x80\\x9d and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down â\\x80\\x9cstupid thingsâ\\x80\\x9d on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how to spell â\\x80\\x9cstupidâ\\x80\\x9d and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him â\\x80\\x9cA nice muddle their slatesâ\\x80\\x99ll be in before the trialâ\\x80\\x99s overâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked This of course Alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate â\\x80\\x9cHerald read the accusationâ\\x80\\x9d said the King On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as followsâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cThe Queen of Hearts she made some tarts All on a summer day The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts And took them quite awayâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cConsider your verdictâ\\x80\\x9d the King said to the jury â\\x80\\x9cNot yet not yetâ\\x80\\x9d the Rabbit hastily interrupted â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a great deal to come before thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCall the first witnessâ\\x80\\x9d said the King and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out â\\x80\\x9cFirst witnessâ\\x80\\x9d The first witness was the Hatter He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other â\\x80\\x9cI beg pardon your Majestyâ\\x80\\x9d he began â\\x80\\x9cfor bringing these in but I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t quite finished my tea when I was sent forâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou ought to have finishedâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cWhen did you beginâ\\x80\\x9d The Hatter looked at the March Hare who had followed him into the court arminarm with the Dormouse â\\x80\\x9cFourteenth of March I think it wasâ\\x80\\x9d he said â\\x80\\x9cFifteenthâ\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare â\\x80\\x9cSixteenthâ\\x80\\x9d added the Dormouse â\\x80\\x9cWrite that downâ\\x80\\x9d the King said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence â\\x80\\x9cTake off your hatâ\\x80\\x9d the King said to the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99t mineâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cStolenâ\\x80\\x9d the King exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact â\\x80\\x9cI keep them to sellâ\\x80\\x9d the Hatter added as an explanation â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve none of my own Iâ\\x80\\x99m a hatterâ\\x80\\x9d Here the Queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the Hatter who turned pale and fidgeted â\\x80\\x9cGive your evidenceâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cand donâ\\x80\\x99t be nervous or Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have you executed on the spotâ\\x80\\x9d This did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the Queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the breadandbutter Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her â\\x80\\x9cI wish you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t squeeze soâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse who was sitting next to her â\\x80\\x9cI can hardly breatheâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t help itâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice very meekly â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m growingâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve no right to grow hereâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t talk nonsenseâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice more boldly â\\x80\\x9cyou know youâ\\x80\\x99re growing tooâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes but I grow at a reasonable paceâ\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse â\\x80\\x9cnot in that ridiculous fashionâ\\x80\\x9d And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter and just as the Dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court â\\x80\\x9cBring me the list of the singers in the last concertâ\\x80\\x9d on which the wretched Hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off â\\x80\\x9cGive your evidenceâ\\x80\\x9d the King repeated angrily â\\x80\\x9cor Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have you executed whether youâ\\x80\\x99re nervous or notâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a poor man your Majestyâ\\x80\\x9d the Hatter began in a trembling voice â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94and I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t begun my teaâ\\x80\\x94not above a week or soâ\\x80\\x94and what with the breadandbutter getting so thinâ\\x80\\x94and the twinkling of the teaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe twinkling of the whatâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cIt began with the teaâ\\x80\\x9d the Hatter replied â\\x80\\x9cOf course twinkling begins with a Tâ\\x80\\x9d said the King sharply â\\x80\\x9cDo you take me for a dunce Go onâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a poor manâ\\x80\\x9d the Hatter went on â\\x80\\x9cand most things twinkled after thatâ\\x80\\x94only the March Hare saidâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry â\\x80\\x9cYou didâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cI deny itâ\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare â\\x80\\x9cHe denies itâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cleave out that partâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell at any rate the Dormouse saidâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d the Hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the Dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep â\\x80\\x9cAfter thatâ\\x80\\x9d continued the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cI cut some more breadandbutterâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut what did the Dormouse sayâ\\x80\\x9d one of the jury asked â\\x80\\x9cThat I canâ\\x80\\x99t rememberâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cYou must rememberâ\\x80\\x9d remarked the King â\\x80\\x9cor Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have you executedâ\\x80\\x9d The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter and went down on one knee â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a poor man your Majestyâ\\x80\\x9d he began â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re a very poor speakerâ\\x80\\x9d said the King Here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court (As that is rather a hard word I will just explain to you how it was done They had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat upon it) â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m glad Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen that doneâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials â\\x80\\x9cThere was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the courtâ\\x80\\x9d and I never understood what it meant till nowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf thatâ\\x80\\x99s all you know about it you may stand downâ\\x80\\x9d continued the King â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t go no lowerâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m on the floor as it isâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThen you may sit downâ\\x80\\x9d the King replied Here the other guineapig cheered and was suppressed â\\x80\\x9cCome that finished the guineapigsâ\\x80\\x9d thought Alice â\\x80\\x9cNow we shall get on betterâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d rather finish my teaâ\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter with an anxious look at the Queen who was reading the list of singers â\\x80\\x9cYou may goâ\\x80\\x9d said the King and the Hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94and just take his head off outsideâ\\x80\\x9d the Queen added to one of the officers but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door â\\x80\\x9cCall the next witnessâ\\x80\\x9d said the King The next witness was the Duchessâ\\x80\\x99s cook She carried the pepperbox in her hand and Alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once â\\x80\\x9cGive your evidenceâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cShanâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d said the cook The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit who said in a low voice â\\x80\\x9cYour Majesty must crossexamine this witnessâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell if I must I mustâ\\x80\\x9d the King said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice â\\x80\\x9cWhat are tarts made ofâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPepper mostlyâ\\x80\\x9d said the cook â\\x80\\x9cTreacleâ\\x80\\x9d said a sleepy voice behind her â\\x80\\x9cCollar that Dormouseâ\\x80\\x9d the Queen shrieked out â\\x80\\x9cBehead that Dormouse Turn that Dormouse out of court Suppress him Pinch him Off with his whiskersâ\\x80\\x9d For some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the Dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared â\\x80\\x9cNever mindâ\\x80\\x9d said the King with an air of great relief â\\x80\\x9cCall the next witnessâ\\x80\\x9d And he added in an undertone to the Queen â\\x80\\x9cReally my dear you must crossexamine the next witness It quite makes my forehead acheâ\\x80\\x9d Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94for they havenâ\\x80\\x99t got much evidence yetâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name â\\x80\\x9cAliceâ\\x80\\x9d CHAPTER XII Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s Evidence â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x9d cried Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before â\\x80\\x9cOh I beg your pardonâ\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox or they would die â\\x80\\x9cThe trial cannot proceedâ\\x80\\x9d said the King in a very grave voice â\\x80\\x9cuntil all the jurymen are back in their proper placesâ\\x80\\x94allâ\\x80\\x9d he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at Alice as he said so Alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put the Lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move She soon got it out again and put it right â\\x80\\x9cnot that it signifies muchâ\\x80\\x9d she said to herself â\\x80\\x9cI should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the otherâ\\x80\\x9d As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the Lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you know about this businessâ\\x80\\x9d the King said to Alice â\\x80\\x9cNothingâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cNothing whateverâ\\x80\\x9d persisted the King â\\x80\\x9cNothing whateverâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s very importantâ\\x80\\x9d the King said turning to the jury They were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the White Rabbit interrupted â\\x80\\x9cUnimportant your Majesty means of courseâ\\x80\\x9d he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke â\\x80\\x9cUnimportant of course I meantâ\\x80\\x9d the King hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone â\\x80\\x9cimportantâ\\x80\\x94unimportantâ\\x80\\x94unimportantâ\\x80\\x94importantâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d as if he were trying which word sounded best Some of the jury wrote it down â\\x80\\x9cimportantâ\\x80\\x9d and some â\\x80\\x9cunimportantâ\\x80\\x9d Alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates â\\x80\\x9cbut it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter a bitâ\\x80\\x9d she thought to herself At this moment the King who had been for some time busily writing in his notebook cackled out â\\x80\\x9cSilenceâ\\x80\\x9d and read out from his book â\\x80\\x9cRule Fortytwo All persons more than a mile high to leave the courtâ\\x80\\x9d Everybody looked at Alice â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not a mile highâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cYou areâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cNearly two miles highâ\\x80\\x9d added the Queen â\\x80\\x9cWell I shanâ\\x80\\x99t go at any rateâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cbesides thatâ\\x80\\x99s not a regular rule you invented it just nowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the oldest rule in the bookâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cThen it ought to be Number Oneâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice The King turned pale and shut his notebook hastily â\\x80\\x9cConsider your verdictâ\\x80\\x9d he said to the jury in a low trembling voice â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s more evidence to come yet please your Majestyâ\\x80\\x9d said the White Rabbit jumping up in a great hurry â\\x80\\x9cthis paper has just been picked upâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s in itâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen â\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t opened it yetâ\\x80\\x9d said the White Rabbit â\\x80\\x9cbut it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner toâ\\x80\\x94to somebodyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt must have been thatâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cunless it was written to nobody which isnâ\\x80\\x99t usual you knowâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWho is it directed toâ\\x80\\x9d said one of the jurymen â\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99t directed at allâ\\x80\\x9d said the White Rabbit â\\x80\\x9cin fact thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing written on the outsideâ\\x80\\x9d He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added â\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99t a letter after all itâ\\x80\\x99s a set of versesâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAre they in the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s handwritingâ\\x80\\x9d asked another of the jurymen â\\x80\\x9cNo theyâ\\x80\\x99re notâ\\x80\\x9d said the White Rabbit â\\x80\\x9cand thatâ\\x80\\x99s the queerest thing about itâ\\x80\\x9d (The jury all looked puzzled) â\\x80\\x9cHe must have imitated somebody elseâ\\x80\\x99s handâ\\x80\\x9d said the King (The jury all brightened up again) â\\x80\\x9cPlease your Majestyâ\\x80\\x9d said the Knave â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t write it and they canâ\\x80\\x99t prove I did thereâ\\x80\\x99s no name signed at the endâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf you didnâ\\x80\\x99t sign itâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cthat only makes the matter worse You must have meant some mischief or else youâ\\x80\\x99d have signed your name like an honest manâ\\x80\\x9d There was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day â\\x80\\x9cThat proves his guiltâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen â\\x80\\x9cIt proves nothing of the sortâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cWhy you donâ\\x80\\x99t even know what theyâ\\x80\\x99re aboutâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cRead themâ\\x80\\x9d said the King The White Rabbit put on his spectacles â\\x80\\x9cWhere shall I begin please your Majestyâ\\x80\\x9d he asked â\\x80\\x9cBegin at the beginningâ\\x80\\x9d the King said gravely â\\x80\\x9cand go on till you come to the end then stopâ\\x80\\x9d These were the verses the White Rabbit readâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cThey told me you had been to her And mentioned me to him She gave me a good character But said I could not swim He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true) If she should push the matter on What would become of you I gave her one they gave him two You gave us three or more They all returned from him to you Though they were mine before If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair He trusts to you to set them free Exactly as we were My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him and ourselves and it Donâ\\x80\\x99t let him know she liked them best For this must ever be A secret kept from all the rest Between yourself and meâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the most important piece of evidence weâ\\x80\\x99ve heard yetâ\\x80\\x9d said the King rubbing his hands â\\x80\\x9cso now let the juryâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf any one of them can explain itâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a bit afraid of interrupting him) â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll give him sixpence I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe thereâ\\x80\\x99s an atom of meaning in itâ\\x80\\x9d The jury all wrote down on their slates â\\x80\\x9cShe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t believe thereâ\\x80\\x99s an atom of meaning in itâ\\x80\\x9d but none of them attempted to explain the paper â\\x80\\x9cIf thereâ\\x80\\x99s no meaning in itâ\\x80\\x9d said the King â\\x80\\x9cthat saves a world of trouble you know as we neednâ\\x80\\x99t try to find any And yet I donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye â\\x80\\x9cI seem to see some meaning in them after all â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94said I could not swimâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d you canâ\\x80\\x99t swim can youâ\\x80\\x9d he added turning to the Knave The Knave shook his head sadly â\\x80\\x9cDo I look like itâ\\x80\\x9d he said (Which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard) â\\x80\\x9cAll right so farâ\\x80\\x9d said the King and he went on muttering over the verses to himself â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98We know it to be trueâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 thatâ\\x80\\x99s the jury of courseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98I gave her one they gave him twoâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 why that must be what he did with the tarts you knowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut it goes on â\\x80\\x98they all returned from him to youâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cWhy there they areâ\\x80\\x9d said the King triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table â\\x80\\x9cNothing can be clearer than that Then againâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98before she had this fitâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 you never had fits my dear I thinkâ\\x80\\x9d he said to the Queen â\\x80\\x9cNeverâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted) â\\x80\\x9cThen the words donâ\\x80\\x99t fit youâ\\x80\\x9d said the King looking round the court with a smile There was a dead silence â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a punâ\\x80\\x9d the King added in an offended tone and everybody laughed â\\x80\\x9cLet the jury consider their verdictâ\\x80\\x9d the King said for about the twentieth time that day â\\x80\\x9cNo noâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen â\\x80\\x9cSentence firstâ\\x80\\x94verdict afterwardsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cStuff and nonsenseâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice loudly â\\x80\\x9cThe idea of having the sentence firstâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHold your tongueâ\\x80\\x9d said the Queen turning purple â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice â\\x80\\x9cOff with her headâ\\x80\\x9d the Queen shouted at the top of her voice Nobody moved â\\x80\\x9cWho cares for youâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time) â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re nothing but a pack of cardsâ\\x80\\x9d At this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face â\\x80\\x9cWake up Alice dearâ\\x80\\x9d said her sister â\\x80\\x9cWhy what a long sleep youâ\\x80\\x99ve hadâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had such a curious dreamâ\\x80\\x9d said Alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said â\\x80\\x9cIt was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea itâ\\x80\\x99s getting lateâ\\x80\\x9d So Alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been But her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dreamâ\\x80\\x94 First she dreamed of little Alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hersâ\\x80\\x94she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyesâ\\x80\\x94and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisterâ\\x80\\x99s dream The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried byâ\\x80\\x94the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolâ\\x80\\x94she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their neverending meal and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to executionâ\\x80\\x94once more the pigbaby was sneezing on the Duchessâ\\x80\\x99s knee while plates and dishes crashed around itâ\\x80\\x94once more the shriek of the Gryphon the squeaking of the Lizardâ\\x80\\x99s slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in Wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull realityâ\\x80\\x94the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsâ\\x80\\x94the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheepbells and the Queenâ\\x80\\x99s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boyâ\\x80\\x94and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the Gryphon and all the other queer noises would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farmyardâ\\x80\\x94while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtleâ\\x80\\x99s heavy sobs Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days THE END END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICEâ\\x80\\x99S ADVENTURES IN
