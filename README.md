## :writing_hand: Project Description:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a significant part of artificial Intelligence, which incorporates AI, which con- tributes to 
finding productive approaches to speak with people and gain from the associations with them. 
As LSTM is Long short time memory it will understand the past text and predict the words which may be helpful for the user to frame sentences and this technique
uses a letter to letter prediction means it predicts a character to create a word. As writing an essay and framing a big para-graph are time-consuming it will
help end-users to frame important parts of the paragraph and help users to focus on the topic instead of wasting time on what to type next.
Next Word Prediction is also called Language Model-ing that is the task of predicting what word comes next.
